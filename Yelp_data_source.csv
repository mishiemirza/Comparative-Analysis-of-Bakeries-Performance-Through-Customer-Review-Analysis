Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,23-Aug-15,Manchester,"Barbakan is an excellent deli, with some astonishingly low prices (a large and sumptuous looking pork pie was less than £3). There's lots to look at and a nice outdoor eating area where on Saturday morning they were cooking up several varieties of sausage, plus lamb burger. I had a delicious bratwurst and was particularly delighted by the wide range of condiments.

Excited already for my next visit!",Natalie W.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,20-Nov-16,Manchester,"TL;DR - Really nice food store and eatery.

We popped down here on a cold winter's morning after hearing so many good things about the place. First impression - it's popular! The queue was stretching out of the door!

The main part of the unit is a shop with lots of different food produce for sale, from the locally sourced through the exotic and unusual. Whether you need local honey or an exotic spice, you'll find it here. Along the back of the store and the right hand wall are counters with all manner of produce for sale - sandwiches, cheese, charcuterie... all looking delicious and tempting. Behind the counter is what they're famous for here - many, many different types of bread. There's also an outdoor seating area where a BBQ was serving up hot food to order.

We came and had a couple of hot ciabattas which were really nice, along with a cup of coffee, and the price was very reasonable (about £5 each). They do a nice loyalty deal too, where after 5 sandwich and coffee purchases you get another free, and after three free ones you can enter a prize draw.

My main reason for not giving a full five stars is the complicated queueing system. There were two queues - one for the BBQ and another for the counter, but if you were waiting for the counter you were supposed to take a numbered ticket... which kinda made the queue irrelevant, and it wasn't obvious you should take a ticket. As a result, people were getting to the front of the queue without tickets and getting served and a few people were getting quite irate.

All in all, it's a nice place which is possibly let down just a fraction by its own sheer popularity.",Paul B.,4 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,18-Oct-15,Manchester,"Shop/deli/bakery serving a selection of hot breakfast items. Bacon or vegetarian sausage with free range eggs on ciabatta or a barm. Plus a few extras and variations on that.

I selected a bacon & egg ciabatta with tomato ketchup. It was very tasty, though there was only just enough bacon. I also ordered a tea, which could have been a bit hotter.

The shop sells a varied mixture of goods. You wouldn't do a weekly shop here but if you need vanilla pods or a jar of Polish horseradish then you can get it here.

Why not the full five stars? Firstly, the lady who served me made no effort to be friendly, or even particularly pleasant. Secondly there's only seating for 2 people indoors. The rest of the seating is outside. That's OK in July and August but not for the other 10 months of the year.

Various different sausages and onions were being cooked on a grill outside. I'll go back for lunch someday and try one.",James C.,4 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,07-Sep-15,Manchester,"After a caffeine fuelled Monday morning I needed something quick, tasty and filling to spark my afternoon. I was in the area and had read some good things about Barbakan so I thought I'd give them a shot. I'm glad I did!

I ordered a sarnie that wasn't even on the menu, yet the member of staff who served me, who was an absolute delight, had no problem going back and making it for me. I have to give her a special mention as it was probably the friendliest and cheery customer service I had ever received, anywhere. I think the Sandwich (a good size for lunch) and a bottle of water set me back £4 - I'd pay that for the customer service alone!

Now they are much more than a sandwich shop, they boast a large cheese counter and a good selection of Deli meats as well as other essentials you might need to grab if you can't make it out to a big supermarket or prefer shopping local (Yelp brownie points if you do).

A great place, that seems to handle all aspects really well - oh yeah, and the customer service is fantastic, don't think I mentioned that yet?",Matt F.,5 star rating

Yes, a cute little grocery shop with local, and organic produce that everybody can enjoy. Yes their bakery is wonderful and always sells out every weekend. Yes they have a cheese counter that would make most people weak at the knees.But the thing that will make you make a special journey to Chorlton are the selection of sausages that they cook on their outside griddle on a Saturday. Absolutely delicious! With a selection of sauces ranging from sweet onion jam to a variety of mustards, the perfect topping makes this one of the best meals I've eaten in the whole of Manchester.

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,24-Jun-14,Manchester,"How and why have I not reviewed the Barbakan yet?!

It is one of the great tragedies of my life that by the time I get off the bus in Chorlton on an evening the Barbakan is already closed - and yet smells unreasonably delicious.

Saturday mornings are my usual time to visit, for a bacon and egg ciabatta and a cake. I never plan to get a cake but the selection is so tempting that I can't seem to leave without one. Anything that involves flaky pastry and a fruity filling has been a winner so far. I would also recommend the cream-filled doughnut. Price are not cheap but also nothing out of the ordinary for Chorlton.

Be warned there is sometimes a thoroughly confusing ticket system in operation for the queues when it gets busy. My first experience of this was walking past the ticket dispenser, jumping in the queue and then standing there looking lost until someone took pity on me.

If you like bread, meat, cheese or olives you're in luck here. My current recurring daydream is buying a huge hamper of their goodies and heading off for a picnic.

Head over on a Saturday lunchtime for a sausage cooked in a huge pan outside. I opted for a Polish sausage with onions and a range of sauces, and a portion of fried potatoes split between 2 (these portions are huge!).

Overall I think the Barbakan is an absolute gem and I feel really lucky to live so close by.",Emily B.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,07-Apr-16,Manchester,"My other half used to live near the Barbakan before I moved to Manchester. With her being in a house share, with a less than ideal cooking situation and us both being pretty lazy, the Barbakan was always an ideal solution.

We have popped in for breakfast sandwiches as well as the grill for lunch they do on a Saturday. Every time (there were quite a few occasions) we've always had great food provided. Further to this the bread and deli counters are great, offering a great variety of treats for those days when we opted not to have the sausages and potatoes being grilled outside.

The prices are good and the staff are friendly. The only complaints I would have is that there is sometimes a pretty big queue, their old school deli ticket numbering system isn't my thing and I think they're closed on Sundays. Which means my hangovers usually have to be taken care of elsewhere (booo!)

Overall the Barbakan is great and is one of the main reasons why I miss living in Chorlton.",Rich C.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,05-Jul-13,"Los Angeles, United States","Local gem! Came to Manchester to visit my boyfriend's family and found this delicatessen on yelp. Great selection of breads, cured meats, cheeses and other grocery goodies. I shared a quiche and hot sandwich and was not disappointed. There is a nice patio out front to enjoy your purchases. I will be back for more!

Their website is very helpful with a nice youtube video. Enjoy!

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,09-Jul-16,Greater Manchester,What a fantastic deli situated amongst coffee shops tea room real ale and even a veggie supermarket. This place is special whether you come along on Saturday to sample the German street food that is cooked on the bbq outside the shop you can have Bockwurst sausage with sautéed potato and fried onion served on a large bun with mustard or ketchup. You might want to try a burger as well. Once inside you will be treated to s feast of European food at the deli counters. Cold nests cured meats cheese quiche olives German sausage polish sausage Amy kind of sausage. Bread is another speciality with polish rye being a particular favourite.

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,04-Oct-15,Manchester,"This delicatessen in Charlton is one of the best places I've got visited in Manchester. As you walk in the store, there are counters at the side and back, each selling something different - olives, cheeses, salads, meats, bread cakes, sandwiches and finally hot soup.  You can sit outside on the patio to eat the food you have just bought, but there is no indoor seating. In the shop you can buy pasta, jams, luxury hampers etc.  I will definitely be going back for a breakfast again as the food was excellent.   This place gets five stars from me!",Andy H.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,16-Nov-15,Manchester,"Barbakan Deli is pretty much the ultimate Chorlton location. It sells a very wide range of superb foods, both ready to eat and world food ingredients. If you were being unkind you might suggest that the reason it is literally the best reviewed eatery in Manchester (#1 on Yelp as I type) is partially down to the punters in Chorlton going hog-crazy for what it offers, but it still offers really good stuff at very solid value.

Barbakan is a foodie's dream, and specialises in 'the finer things'. Everything is done to a seriously high quality, but what impresses me most is the range. Barbakan succeeds in sourcing great bread (from bagels to posh loaves), cheese (the counter needs to be seen to be believed), cold meats (even more impressive than the cheese selection), salads, quiches, and more. On Saturdays they set up a BBQ on the patio and cook bratwurst and french sausage to order for £3.30 per hot dog. And if you want to whip up something nice at home they sell everything from tahini (at a much cheaper price than M&S) to fancy Italian pastas to Polish ingredients and even the odd kosher item. It is simply a one stop shop for anyone wanting to eat or cook something a bit special.

And the value is excellent. The food isn't dirt cheap, but it is hardly dear (and they have an odd habit of pricing things to non-rounded numbers, for some reason). Given the luxurious nature of most of what is on offer the prices are extremely reasonable. Is it the best place to buy food in Manchester? Who knows. But if you've ever got a spare bob or two in the weekly food budget then head to Barbakan, you won't be disappointed.",Pip M.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,21-Oct-09,Manchester,"This is by far the best deli I have been to in Manchester. The food is gorgeous and freshly prepared in house.

The cakes and bread are so scrumptious you will never want to buy from any other shopped again. The bagels are my recommendation.

Chortlton has is so right with its fabulous bars and restaurants, when I discovered it had such an amazing deli...I did pause to consider moving out of the city centre to live there...it was only a pause mind as I am a city girl through and through. If there was a Barbakan in the city centre my life would be complete.





This is the nicest Deli I have ever been to - the food is fresh and appetising and beautifully displayed. There's a great choice including lots for veggies and the prices are pretty reasonable. The cakes are fabulous. Parking can be an issue nearby, and if your not local you could be disappointed if you don't get somewhere near by. The staff are very friendly too!",alexandra s.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,24-Oct-09,"Hastings, East Sussex","I have to put a shout out to this Deli too. I haven't found a better one in Manchester yet. I mean, what other deli can boast over 40 years in operation, and being the preferred supplier of stores like Selfridges and Harvey Nicks?

There's so many varieties of meats, cheeses, breads, conserves, relishes, home made salads of vegetables, rice, pasta. They stock so many items from around the world that you just can't buy anywhere else. And don't get me started on the cakes and pastries in here, you won't know where to look or which one to try first.

The fact that the deli has just won the Food and Drink Supplier of Year again is further testament to this incredible food store.",Angela B.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,12-Jan-10,Manchester,"In my last job it was decided to have a monthly 'team lunch'. Being a vegetarian and working in a team full of Germans, I was sceptical. Couldn't we just skip the salami and chit-chat and go home an hour early instead?

However, after the first lunch I noticed that I had suddenly become very popular among the Germans, and the reason why? Barbakan!

I had brought three fresh loaves from Barbakan that morning, which set me back around £5. It had taken all my inner strength not to bite the top off the delicious parmesan and herb baguette that had been sticking out of my shopping bag on the bus to work. The smell was even worth a fiver - amazing!

From then on in I was immediately requested to bring the bread for every team lunch, party, gathering etc and even used to pick up individuals' orders for 'the twisty rolls' or the 'dark German round loaf'. Barbakan's staff are always great, and on numerous occasions have patiently helped me to satisfy the picky taste buds of the Germans despite the queue of regulars with their numbered tickets waiting to be served.",Kirsten P.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,05-Jan-13,Manchester,"Another update, this time on the glorious merits of eating in at Barbakan on a weekday lunchtime in winter. Of course, there -is- copious outside seating under cover for the good weather. But if you want to bag one of the ten or so bar stools inside, weekday would seem to be more realistic.

I've now uploaded a decent photo of the Mediterranean Sizzler toasted ciabatta (£3.50) which came out just as good as on a weekend, but much more quickly! I have to say that this ciabatta beats most pizzas I have ever eaten, and so in the vicinity of Barbakan I would henceforth only be interested in a very, very exquisite artisan pizza. Here's why:

- Cheap
- Not too much bread, but still satisfying enough that no-one of normal appetite would want a second or even another half
- Light, airy, crisp yet substantial Barbakan ciabatta freshly baked on the premises
- Served at perfect eating temperature
- Pizza-type ingredients - feta, roast mediterrean veg, fresh spinach - keeping it moist yet never soggy
- Very reliable - difficult to see Barbakan ever dropping the ball on this sandwich. (Contrast loads of pizzas with burnt or soggy bases *sigh*)

As I wanted a big feed, I also had mediterrean vegetable soup (see photo) which comes with a bread roll. Soup was something under £2 for a cup a bit smaller than Unicorn's £1.58 soup, but with bread roll included it all balances out, especially as it is tough to buy a small bit of bread at Unicorn. Soup, roll and sandwich adds up to a tasty, wholesome meal which makes plenty of inroads into my five-a-day. (OK, quite a high carb meal, but you said you wanted pizza!)

Lastly, when I asked, they were OK with swapping the free bread roll for a bagel, so I will have soup and bagel next time. So the future is looking bright - Happy New Year, everyone!",William G.,5 star rating

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,31-Mar-14,Manchester,"The best hangover breakfast around! The sausage pan Saturday mornings draw large queues from the Chorlton crowd and beyond. Freshly cooked to order - huge portions and good value for money. And that's just outside!
Inside is a large selection of freshly cooked breads, meat, cheese, homemade baked goods (quiche, pastries, cakes) and salads. Also stocks international products and a variety of local producers.

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,25-Jul-11,Manchester,"After shopping at Unicorn one Saturday morning the only sensible thing to do was to go to Barbakan since we could see it from our car and we were slightly hungry.

I tried to resist having anything to eat, my boyfriend had amazing bacon and sausage ciabatta, the ciabatta was so crisp and soft and chewy, beyond any other I've tried, and the sausage was AMAZING as well.


i don't really like bacon.

The place was really busy so I sat waiting for my partner to return from the counter and I tried SO hard to resist anything from the outdoor barbeque they had to set up. They had three or four different types of sausage, polish, french etc with roasted herby potatoes and onions. I tried really hard but couldn't resist and for four pounds i got an enormous french garlic hotdog with a mountain of onions and an inedible amount of scorchingly hot potatoes.

There were a million chutneys to try all of which were delicious. I feigned that I would be able to take the left overs home because it came in a polystyrene box but sadly I ate the whole thing :(.

It was a nice day and it was lovely to be able to sit outside and eat massive amounts of food.

The baked cheesecake they do is so out of this world. It's so creamy and dense and light at the same time somehow, it's worth driving there just for that. Where ever you are even if you are in Berlin.",Jessica Z.,4 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,10-Jun-14,Manchester,"Five stars. Barbakan can't be improved in my opinion. The bread is incredible and sets chorlton alive with the smell of fresh baking on a Saturday morning! They have everything covered, sandwiches, cakes, deli treats, and then to top it all off, they hold a weekly barbecue out front which knocks out bratwurst to put the European Market to shame. There's Paella, roasted potatoes garlic sausage and more. Outside seating is lovely even in the winter. Much like Frosts do with meat, Barbakan provide bread products to a host of restaurants across Manchester to such a high standard that those venues advertise it proudly. When other businesses are buying your product and advertising your quality, you know you're good. Exceptional business.",Colin O.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,17-Sep-11,"Bellevue, United States","I headed back to Chorlton's infamous Polish deli today to pick up some ingredients for buffet Sunday. (Disclaimer: I will eventually get the Sunday roast right, I know it's all in the timing, but at least with my homemade buffet I can always pre-prep stuff...) The plan was to make a quiche and some bruschetta as well as a number of other things I'd be picking up for elsewhere. I was pretty much open. I hopped into Barbakan looking for guidance. And guidance was what I found.

I wandered past their delicious looking and smelling barbecue in the market for three things - bread, cheese and chorizo. I was contemplating their potato and rosemary loaf again but I actually clocked a bread there was only one left of... good sign if ever there was one, hmm? Needless to say it was chockfull of pecorino cheese, olives, sundried tomatoes and herbs, and I simply couldn't resist nibbling a chunk as I waited for the bus later on. Meanwhile once I had my bread I told the gent (who offered to slice it too) I was picking up a few more things, and he said, 'That's fine, I'll serve you all the way round.' You stay with one server! That's most comforting. And I started harping on about the quiche, and he sought the advice of his coworker who recommended a raclette. Sold. I also picked up a strong cheddar for the bruschetta and even got some hints re: what to pop in the quiche - my server's companion insisted that walnuts are a must. The proof will be in the eating tomorrow, but I can assure you it - smells - AMAZING.

Two cheeses, a giant loaf and some amazing chorizo (okay, I'm not an expert but I trust these guys!) at less than a tenner, with money going into the pockets of a great local business. Now that I've found a bus route that goes from right outside my flat to the edge of Manchester Road, I'll be finding plentiful excuses to become a regular here! Note to self: go for breakfast and try their coffee. Next time for sure.",Emma Louise M.,5 star rating
Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,22-Nov-12,"Seattle, United States","With so many great things going for this store, it's hard to know where to start...*Spins the wheel*Chronological order it is!You'll start off walking down the street, minding your own business, when you get the sixth sense-style of tingle letting you know something magical is happening nearby.  This is followed by the enticing aroma of freshly baked bread.  It doesn't matter if it's morning, afternoon, or at 3 in the morning, you WILL smell the bread (I like to imagine there are several elves working throughout the night, of the Keebler variety, but more likely it's the proofing dough).  If you're walking by on a Saturday morning, you'll instead get a punch to the nose by the smell of delicious sausages being grilled up front, served on a bun.  WARNING: unless you are a vegetarian (and in some cases, even then), exposing yourself to this smell WILL result in the immediate consumption of massive amounts of sausage, followed swiftly by meat nirvana.So now, unable to control your movements, you have walked to the open air grill and ordered one of the many varieties of sausage they offer.  If you're particularly hungry, you'll wind up with some potatoes, beans, or stew/curry of some sort on your plate as well - don't worry, this is normal, and next time you come you'll find some items may have changed.  You wait for a few minutes so they can get it juicy and cooked perfectly.  It will feel as if two lifetimes have passed, but worry not, for in this land of bliss and happiness we never age, and the expert chefs are making your ambrosia to order.At this point, the cook has handed you a perfectly cooked sausage in a roll.  You have the choice to devour it all right there as people stare at you awkwardly (my usual choice of consumption), or you can act civilised and walk to the front area where they have plasticware, napkins, and a large selection of sauces to coat your brunch with.  Feel free to use these sauces if the taste of pure awesomeness is too much for you and you need to have it diluted.  Now grab your grub, being careful to tuck it under an arm to prevent the people in line from stealing it, and walk to one of the patio tables.  Sit down, soak up some sun (if available that day), and enjoy your breakfast/brunch/lunch.  Repeat as needed.Now thoroughly satisfied (or, if it's not a Saturday morning and you haven't been distracted by the grill), your attention turns to the actual store.  Through the windows, you see massive amounts of people, and assorted delicious-looking foodstuffs.  As you wander inside, the aroma guaranteeing you that this is a safe haven and no bad can come here, you'll find a wide variety of high-quality groceries.  These can be pricey, but it's worth the cost if you can muster the dough (pun!).  The main point of activity will be the counter with people clambering for priority.  This is your next destination.  Go into queue, and buy bread.  Don't ask me what kind - they'll have something you love, whether it's brioche, wheat, or one of several varieties of sourdough, they have TONS of choices.  They also have plenty of snacks to choose from - I usually end up with a handful of scones as well.Now head home with your bag full of goodies, and enjoy!

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,07-Jul-12,London,"I have a soft spot for places that sell quality bread, meat, and cheeses and my, oh my, was I pleased to walk into this place (and in Manchester, England of all places). The fact that England, with its notorious reputation for their cuisine, conjured up a wonderland such as this makes me think twice about our ancestors across the Atlantic. Though the odds of finding a nice sunny day to use their patio out front are slim to none in this country it shouldn't stop you from trying out this incredible gem. Did I mention they have awards? Best bakery of 2011, among other various awards. Tourists of all kinds who are seeking something beyond what you know I urge you to go to this delicatessen.

Centered around Polish meats and breads, this delicatessen is staffed with at least one or two knowledgeable employees in each section. A simple rectangular shop with no flashy flaunt, one wall is devoted entirely to bread of the freshest and most gorgeous kind. If carbohydrates are your weakness then, lord, this is the arrow to your Achilles heel. Another wall is a shrine to cured meats and cheeses, and I nearly fell to the floor in worship. Unpasteurized cheese, my queen, my goddess and yet my malicious mistress that is so unfortunately missing in my home country. Much like my many reviews of Star Provisions and Marche Jean-Talon, this Delicatessen is a home to all foodies who enjoy a good market with high quality food.

Here's the amazing thing, it's much cheaper than I thought it would be. Unlike Whole Foods and Star Provisions for 100 grams of three types of meats, and two different types of cheese it only came out to about £10. I was very happy to hear this as normally I spend over $20 at Star Provisions for only two cheeses. Tourists and foodie tourists alike, be sure to stop by here and try not to lose your head.

If capable of putting forward the quality of words needed my review would read more like a love letter. Still, I unashamedly wish the inhabitants and visitors of Manchester to take some precious time out of their lives to visit the greatest deli in this City and indeed quite possibly the Northwest. If you have not already stepped onto its hallowed ground, you may think me over-the-top, but all those who have (and form part of the small queue that is ever present) and like me really do travel from miles around to stock up on staples like rye bread flavoured with caraway seeds - a heavenly addition to Sunday mornings BLT, or even the unique chocolate bread that has tempted many a follower of Barbakan, they all know it something very special.

There is always an extraordinary and far flung sourced selection of cheeses, meats, cakes, pate's, salads and not forgetting its 50 different types of bread that form just the basis of what is available. The Polish roots of this family run business shine through and would be instantly recognisable to most old school Europeans who would feel right at home in old blighty upon a visit here, but what amazes me most is that in 40 years of business this background and tradition has filtered down to create a plethora of new interesting incarnations of traditional recipes that you will definitely not find anywhere else in Manchester!!

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,03-Feb-10,Manchester,"Situated in the bustling heart of Chorlton, the Barbakan is quite simply one of the best independent deli's in the North West of England - a fact which has not gone unnoticed, seeing as it recently won the Manchester Food and Drink Festival's ""Best Food and Drink Retailer"" award.


Brimming to the seams with delicious goodies, this is the place to go for sumptuous, silky cheeses, exotic looking cold cuts, and a range of salads which are so delicious that I'd gladly bankrupt myself in order to eat my own bodyweight in them each and every day.


OK, so you may have to pay that little bit extra for a loaf of bread - but wow, what bread! Baked on the premises by a team of master bakers, each and every baked good which comes out of that shop is a delight to the senses. Indeed, after one bite of their rye bread, you'll want to chuck that supermarket loaf out of your nearest window.


The best time to visit is undoubtedly on a Saturday when they host a regular barbeque on their patio, serving up an amazing array of grilled meats. I highly recommend the Chorizo, served up in a soft white hot dog roll. And the Lamb and Rosemary sausage with red onion jam. And the Polish Kielbasa with extra garlic, smothered in hot mustard.

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,12-Mar-08,Manchester,"Another visit to this superb deli was long overdue by the time I entered Barbakan in Chorlton this weekend.
Having family up and in the area, I thought it wise to grab some deli supplies for a planned evening meal at home.
According to the history bumf, Barbakan derives it's name from a market place in Krakow, Poland and appears to have landed in Chorlton over 40 years ago.


As I drew near the place I could already sniff out some fine food business going on: lo and behold they have an outdoor cooking situation on Saturdays! Freshly cooked, lovely sausages in a roll and fried potatoes. The second coming for anyone servicing a cheeky hangover I'm quite sure.
Once inside you're presented with a mighty range of 'interesting' food. It's a bit like the Selfridges food hall but marginally cheaper: I say marginally because, to be honest, many of the items are quite pricey. A lot of the Italian range I saw in Italy recently for a fraction of the cost. If you're sensible about it and not get too wide eyed over the continental fare then you'll ultimately think better of the place.
However it's the breads in this deli which set it aside. It won an award (one of many actually) a year or so back for Best Deli in Britain which tells you this is a well respected place.
Offering over fifty different kinds of breads (freshly baked, made with no animal fats therefore vegetarian friendly), a large majority of which I had never heard of, I find it a struggle to choose and often end up in a yeast like state of panic.
Fortunately the staff (mostly Polish themselves) are on hand to help you pick out a bread.
I picked up French sour bread and Marathon bread (partly made with apricots) both of which lived up to expectations. I missed out on the Belgian chocolate bread one for next time.
They make breads for most of the top restaurants and the likes of the aforementioned Selfridges.
I couldn't pass the cold cut counter without grabbing something different to add to the table later on. Come on down 'chicken with aspic' slices. Resembling a facial prosthetic from a George A Romero flick it turned out to be rather tasty: an eloquent slither of textured, free range gherkin I'd describe it as.

Barbakan Delicatessen,4.8,04-Nov-11,Failsworth,"I always remember this place being way better than it is. Now I'm not saying its rubbish because it is far from that. It's just everywhere you go in Manchester and ask where they get their bread from they say the Barbakan, so I often take a trip over to see their huge selection, buy some and it's never as good as I wish it was. But again, it is still good. I just have high expectations. Very high.
So this time we purchased roast potato and rosemary bread which was awesome! Especially with the proper smelly Camembert we bought from the cheese counter. Also the rye bread with apple and pumpkin seeds, now I'm not sure if we were just given rye bread but our loaf had no trace of apples and about three pumpkin seeds in it.
The shop itself is massive and always surprises me how much space they have, The thing I can;t get used to is the ticket system thing. Never have, never will. Sometimes they use it, sometimes they don't.
The deli counter looked amazing with the various salads to choose from and millions of cheese and meats. But how are you meant to decide? I mean really though? We couldn't decide on more than the smelly Camembert and some Gouda from Amsterdam. And then on the drive home ""we should have got some salads"" ""we should have got some meats"". Oh well.
Overall experience was good, but disorganised when it came to being served. The other thing that bugged me was there weren't any signs on the cakes to know what is what without asking.
For a bakery with a reputation like this one, prices are fabulous!
Its a bakery / deli well worth visiting and its probably very easy to do your weekly shop in there.",Grace R.,4 star rating

However, my cappuccino was just milky and hardly any coffee flavour -probably just one shot but you could taste that it was a cheap coffee brand.

JB Richardson The Bakery,4,04-Nov-11,Failsworth,"As a fellow baker, I am always very critical.
Not much to criticise here!
From the moment we walked in and saw the fabulous photography on the wall to the minute we left with £15 worth of cakes I was a happy bunny.
The lady who served us (a character all by herself!) was very helpful and packaged our cakes nicely so we got them (all) home in one piece.
We over indulged in the white ganache tarts, caramel death by chocolate, a selection of chunky chocolate topped chocolate muffins, and a shortbread heart amongst some others. For my particular taste the ganache was slightly too runny, but i had a spoon so it was all good. The chunky chocolate topped muffins were varied from chunks of toblerone, crunchies, white choc etc. and were very tasty and moist, like proper chocolate cake should be, The shortbread was super - perfectly baked with a good amount of jam sandwiched in the middle.
There wasn't much bread left on sale but it was about 3pm so we decided to go to the Barbakan.....",Grace R.,4 star rating

Then followed by a bag of three for £1.20 mini custard tarts (bad), honey bun (a-ok) and a mini custard bun (sooper dooper)!

The prices are excellent - today I picked up a peanut butter bun, a beef satay pasty & a mini custard bun for just £3.20. Custard buns are my favourite - fluffy cloud of 'softer than brioche' bun with a thick sweet custard centre...wish I'd plumped for the 3 for £1.40 deal...but I was making an effort to be restrained today!

Their main competition is Wong Wongs bakery down the road...if you get the chance, try them both as they both share an excellent reputation...WW simply benefits from later opening times (pudding post Cantonese feast) & a fresher interior.",Laura J.,4 star rating

Ho's Bakery,4.1,07-Nov-11,Manchester,"I'm not a regular customer here, so my three star rating stands to say that HO's still seems to me like an A-OK establishment.

However, after lunch at nearby Yuzu, I popped into Hos for a couple of sweet bean balls for dessert. Sorry Ho's, but I wasn't impressed and quite a lot of it ended up in the trash can as I made my way to Wong Wong Bakery for a replacement. I think Ho's were 50p for a larger ball than Wong Wong's, but more was definitely less in this case - not as much bean filling, plus unappetising cotton wool-texture pastry with none of the leathery crispness of Wong Wong's equivalent. See my companion Wong Wong update with cross-sectional photo for a better sweet bean ball!",William G.,3 star rating
Ho's Bakery,4.1,16-Feb-12,Failsworth,"I think Chinese Bakeries are my new ""average love"". Meaning I love going in them even though the stuff isn't great.
After a disappointing experience at a certain tea room in the gay village, we wandered over to China town for a few baked (or fried) treats.
We started with a spring onion fritter which was fab, super greasy and oniony - just what I wanted! And a bubble tea - can someone please explain to me what the hell the ""bubbles"" are? Then followed by a bag of three for £1.20 mini custard tarts (bad), honey bun (a-ok) and a mini custard bun (sooper dooper)!
I think in terms of first impressions of the shop Wong's wins by a mile. The stuff looks nicer in Wongs than in Ho's but the taste is pretty much the same for what I have sampled so far.
Anyway, it makes a great change from the normal butty dinner.",Grace R.,4 star rating
Ho's Bakery,4.1,14-Feb-10,"Leeds, West Yorkshire","It's no Wong Wong's bakery in Manchester, but it's definitely a bit cheaper (we're talking 10-20p cheaper). Don't go for to boba (cause they don't have too much of a selection) but most definitely go there for the AWESOMELY CHEAP and DELICIOUS pastries!!! especially the Egg custard cups (always fresh and a bit warm... just the way I like them) and the sweet buns (CHEAP PERFECTION!). The only bad thing I had there was their red bean fry balls... they were a bit crispy for my taste when they're supposed to be on the moist and chewy side.

staff is a bit frustrating cause they'll always try to rush you, but honey take your time! there's a lot of selection... once you get the hang of what's good and what you like you'll be in-and-out like no other with your orders.",Karm S.,3 star rating

Pollen Bakery,4.4,28-Jul-19,Hong Kong,"Came here on a rainy Sunday brunch. Lovely friendly and cozy atmosphere, we got tables by the window. The coffee was delicious and you could tell it was of high quality. Food arrived quickly. We ordered two poached eggs dishes (one with salmon and one with mushroom) both were unique in the sense that it wasn't just you 'standard smoke salmon and chestnut mushroom'. They used a variety of Japanese mushrooms and were very generous in the portion of the smoked salmon (which was flaky salmon, not the kind from the packet you get in supermarkets!)

Compared to the competitor brunch place in Manchester (federal) I feel as though pollen bakery is well worth the money (£9 for smoked salmon Benedict , £8 for mushroom) and is worth the trip down to the lovely canal side :)",Sophie W.,5 star rating
Pollen Bakery,4.4,09-Jul-24,"Hoboken, United States","This place is quite popular! There was a long line (or queue) but it went pretty quickly. I was happy they had an iced black, since I prefer ice coffees. There is a homemade Yuzu drink that I'd love to try next time. Outside has a few more seats than inside. They can run out of food, so I'd make sure you get here on the early side if you want food. It's a pretty casual spot and loudness level depends on the crowd. The food tastes very good!",Rosemary A.,4 star rating

The vibe here is awesome as well, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, very spacious and next to the water. Would highly recommend this spot!",Andrea W.,5 star rating

Pollen Bakery,4.4,11-Sep-16,Manchester,"Manchester city centre has a sweet new bakery! - and this one specialises in sourdough and dark-bake loaves.

Based in a railway arch on Sheffield Street, just behind Piccadilly Station (a few units down from Track Brewing), their small-but-perfectly-formed bakery will produce various breads, cakes and pastries such as croissants, pains au chocolat and 'cruffins' - a hybrid of muffins and croissants.

They are understandably limited as to how much they can bake each day, so if you don't get down there early, prepare to face empty shelves! Their pastries sold out in less than an hour on opening day.

The owners, Hannah and Chris (of Fil Fil Falafel and S'mores fame) are seriously passionate about their new venture and really know how to bake, so you know their goods will be great.

Keep a watchful eye on their social media feeds (@PollenBakery) and opening times, and support a lovely indie business.

Tip: they accept cash and card payments.",Michael B.,5 star rating
