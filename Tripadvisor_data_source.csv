Hart's Bakery,4.5,TIMONTHE B,Birmingham,5,Excellent customer service,"Popped in here between trains as recommended by colleagues. Nice setting, great place and excellent service by Amy and her colleagues. Would recommend",17/07/2024
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Steve,Plymouth,5,Tasty food at Templemeads,"I looked around Templemeads station between trains for something to eat and found the usual extortionately priced fair. Then I looked at Apple Maps and found this bakery, literally just outside the entrance to the station. The quiche was absolutely delicious. Cooked on the premises and tasted just like it was homemade. I thoroughly recommend it.",26/06/2024
Hart's Bakery,4.5,georgina,Bristol,4,Great artisan bakery but not cheap!,"Excellent artisan bakery.  However, you could buy 4 Greggs' sausage rolls for the price of one here!  The carrot and walnut cake is the best I've ever tasted.  At £3.50 a slice, it's not cheap but highly addictive!",24/06/2024
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Lynne P,,5,Excellent bread and ordering system. ,Ordered bread online. Absolutely delicious and so fresh and so well organised. It was very busy. Looks a lovely place for food. Nice to be able to pre order. ,27/12/2023
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Barns.,Peak District National Park,5,A nice breakfast spot by the station,"I visited twice and had definitely the best pan aux chocolat and pan aux raisins I've tasted anywhere, including in France. The coffee was also nice, although I think it could be slightly larger given the not inconsiderable prices here. It gets very busy and clearly has a regular following.",08/09/2023
Hart's Bakery,4.5,stockdale83,London,5,Good vegan choice,"Nice selection of vegan options (both sweet and savoury) at reasonable prices.

The bakery is located under the arches of the main station on the outside. Be prepared to queue at peak times.",19/08/2023
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Ian M,Backworth,5,Delicious pastries,"The bakery can be found in the arches under the leaving side of the approach to Temple Meads Station, accessed by going down some stairs.  Got some pastries to take on the train, absolutely gorgeous especially the plain croissants. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly.",29/05/2022
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Barrie G,Swindon,5,Birthday Cakes for work colleagues,"Birthday cakes
I ordered the selection of cakes the day before, picked them up the next day. Very friendly and helpful staff. Took the boxes of cakes to work each cake individually wrapped, work mates were over the moon at the  presentation and more importantly the wonderful taste. Would highly recommend Hart’s bakery.",09/04/2022
Hart's Bakery,4.5,smith212016,Bristol,2,Very long wait for not what I asked for,Visited in the morning and ordered a take away coffee. I then had to wait for over 15 minutes and was late so rushed off. Despite asking for a very hot latte I discovered it was basically tepid milk. Won’t be repeating the experience as poor product and service and not cheap.,19/03/2022
Hart's Bakery,4.5,thoughtfuldiner,Edinburgh,4,Good bakery,"What I've tried so far: 

- bread - excellent
- croissants: good
- flat white: disappointing (very weak).

Prices are good for bread, they seem a little too enthusiastic for al the rest. Very popular, be prepared to queue outside.",16/10/2021
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Andrew,Welwyn,5,Simply amazing,"I visited Hart's Bakery to try their legendary sausage rolls. Unfortunately on the day of my visit, they sold out and the next batch is still in the oven so I tried the pork pasty and a piece of shortbread. It was delicious. The pasty filling was generous and very tasty. The shortbread, it was so nice that I tempted to go back for seconds. Will definitely visit again.",23/09/2021
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Blackth0rn,Bristol,5,Excellent as always,"Hidden away in the arches below Temple Meads station, this is well worth taking the trouble to seek out. Do be aware though if you’re driving that car parking is very limited. In theory, they have two parking spaces allocated to the restaurant, but in practise with outside tables being set up at the edge of these, you’d have to drive right up to, almost in to in fact, anybody sat there. One benefit to have come out of Covid is that the goods for sale are now behind a glass counter. I always felt the previous setup with them on open tables where people could cough and splutter all over them was rather unhygienic.

Today’s savoury options were chalked up on a board, and I went for the chipotle pork sausage roll. This was really very good indeed, a tasty and moist pork filling with a lovely crumbly and buttery pastry case. A slice of carrot cake was also very good, a generous portion with a smooth and sweet topping, it certainly hit the spot and this was all washed down with a decent latte. Staff were pleasant and helpful, this really is a hidden gem and well worth a visit.",27/08/2021
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Badmonkey47,Bristol,5,Hidden under Bristol Temple-Meads,"If you can find it, tucked under the railway arches beneath Bristol Temple-Meads station, it’s well worth checking out.

The food is made on site and tastes fantastic. It is fairly pricey but no more than you pay for the inedible overpriced fodder in the station itself.

Find them today (unless it’s Sunday or Monday when they are closed).",07/08/2021
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Jay15432,,5,Delicious,"Great sandwiches, great espresso, delicious pastries. Love their new flavours each week, and classic cakes and brownies.",02/05/2021
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Slartibartfast,,1,Awful,"Poor customer service and way over priced, I mean stupidly over priced - £3.20 for a small sausage roll!! I wouldn't have minded if it was nice but it was an explosion of grease in my mouth when I took a bite. I'm  not even sure the pigeons enjoyed it when I threw the rest of it to them.

Also £2.00 for a thimble sized coffee is a bit expensive for me.",09/01/2021
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Fernando G,London,5,Amazing!,"Because of covid, they were taking only takeaway orders and there was a big queue at the front - which was a good sign! We ate the ham and cheese croissant, the chocolate hazelnut croissant and also had a mocha. IT WAS AMAZING. ",30/08/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Martyn C,,1,Terrible Customer Service and way too expensive,"I work near Temple Meads yet every time I go for lunch they never have anything in stock. The Sausage rolls are amazing but £3.20 is just simply a rip off, especially in the current climate.
I also walked there today and was told they no longer accept cash, despite having the correct money and there being no link to covid or anything else. Which suggests this is another cash grab. Or profiteering. 
I guess it would be nice to see a business putting customers first and not profits.",26/08/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Ann L,Bristol,5,Great little hidden secret,"Great cafe, that is hidden away in the approach section of Bristol Temple Meads, and is approachable by a set of steps - take care when going down these

You can eat in or takeaway and yes it is worth the longer wait for anything as the food is extremely tasty and you pay a bit more but this is value for money - allow a few extra minutes to buy the food as there is often a wait and it is not a fast food place and a bakery instead, especially if you have a train to catch

Much better than the chains that are elsewhere

Service is genuine and great",15/03/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Flossy491,Paignton,5,Possibly just eaten the BEST,Possibly just eaten the BEST cheese & onion toastie I’ve ever had! Not to mention the shortbread! Delicious. Can’t wait to return! ,14/03/2020

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Rae_E,Bristol,5,The best pastries in Bristol.,"The best pastries in Bristol. Period. 

It doesn’t matter how early my train is, I’ll always allow 15 minutes to pick up a cheddar and mustard danish. ",20/02/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Daniel W,Bristol,5,Happy Times at Hart’s,"Tucked away under Temple Meads, Harts boasts a treasure chest of delicious baked goods. From cakes to sausage rolls to breads, all the delicacies are beautifully crafted. We tried a selection of cakes, all of which were perfectly textured and enchantingly flavoured. The coffee was also decent, but definitely not the highlight. For central Bristol, the value holds. Unfortunately the success of the business does come with some downsides. Staff were rushed off their feet, and a little shirty, and the otherwise ambient setting in the railway arches is crowded and boisterous. However, the mouth watering nature of the cakes shines through and makes this a must visit! ",12/02/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,swfoodreviews,Dorset,5,Delicious cakes! ,"A must visit if your in the area. Had the best piece of carrot cake that I’ve had in a long time, sooo tasty! We bought a range of goodies to take back to share with our family and everyone enjoyed them. Top tip -  go as early as you can, yummy things sell out fast! ",07/02/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Tracey,Bath,5,Outstanding cheese toastie,"I’ve heard about this place but never been, silly me! Difficult to find but just follow the hordes of other visitors. I could have brought all of the bed products but instead rationed myself to a rye sourdough, gluten free loaf and of course the toastie which was divine.",24/01/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,David A,Clavering,5,Worth coming to Bristol Temple Meads just to eat here,"Hart’s is as good as ever. Such a great atmosphere, lovely staff and an amazing bakery of course. For breakfast, the egg and bacon muffins are hard to beat. ",07/01/2020
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Andy M,,5,A diamond in the rough,"Its Bristol worst kept secret, I wish every station had a bakery of this quality. The coffee is awesome as are the pastries and other delights. 

Its always busy so in some ways I hope you never find it.",05/11/2019

Hart's Bakery,4.5,One_of_the_BOFs,Cheltenham,5,Great return visit,"We stopped off here on our arrival in Bristol for an overnight stay and drinking trip. The freshly baked sausage rolls, both meat and veggie, were very tasty and the flat white coffee was top notch (as was the service) - the perfect start to a long beery day.",05/09/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Phil Uppamaplate,Bristol,5,Morning croissant,"Almond croissant and a cinnamon bun, best start to the day for quite a while. Huge selection of pastries and savouries available, bakers can be seen behind the counter, will make it a regular morning stop off on the way to work, smells amazing too",04/09/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Martina ➕✖️,Porto San Paolo,4,Bella colazione!,"Parcheggio riservato di fronte alla bakery. Prendiamo un cookie, un pezzo di torta con i lamponi e una torta con limone, semi di papavero e mandorle. Da bere un cappuccino e un elderflower drink. Tutto buono, cappuccino incluso. Il punto in meno per il servizio, in particolare quello al banco che sembrava spazientito e irrequieto. Un sorriso in più non farebbe male!",12/08/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,AKS,,5,Saturday bread is out of this world,"I like to buy bread from here while walking the dog (they are allowed in). There is always a crazy long queue, but it should put people off that are there only for bakery products, the queue is often for coffee. If you can shimmy passed to the bread there are people ready to serve you separately.  I think the sourdough is the best in Bristol. But the Saturday bread was amazing! I should have gotten more than 1 slice- I’ll know for next time.",10/08/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,James C,Bristol,5,Great coffee,"It was an intense coffee experience, smooth with great flavours.I really enjoyed the coffee and would certainly go again.",09/08/2019

Hart's Bakery,4.5,cremsal,,4,Great lunch spot,"This bustling bristol bakery is a great lunch spot. It gets really busy so is best to get here early. I ordered the cheese toastie which was great, they sold out of them by 12.30pm though! We always buy our bread from here and it is delicious!",09/07/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,dispeg,Tonbridge,5,Fantastic surprise,"Having never been to Bristol before, my husband and I asked a helpful gent at Templemeads Station where we could get a good coffee and he suggested this place.  What a find! We did indeed have a lovely coffee in a quirky under-arch space and the baked-on-premises treats tempted us back for lunch later in the day. The soup and sourdough bread was amazing - both for taste and value.  If we find ourselves in Bristol again, we will return here.",21/05/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,David A,Clavering,5,The best start to the day,Breakfast is as good as ever. Bread and cakes looking amazing today. Great atmosphere friendly staff. All brilliant ,08/05/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,MaxJB87,Bristol,5,Amazing evening snack on our wedding day,"We try to go to Hart’s whenever we catch a train as their sweet and savoury pastries are amazing, especially the sausage rolls. In fact we like the sausage rolls so much that my wife and I ordered almost 200 as the evening snack at our wedding and they went down a storm. Laura and her team are always really welcoming and accommodating so I’d highly recommend.",03/05/2019

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Kim P,Rochester,5,Multiple Visits!,"I wish there was a way one could rate something so yummy that it warranted multiple visits! Once I discovered that this place was only a 10 minute walk from my flat, I went back several times over the course of 2 weeks. Get there early!! Items do sell out. I loved the mushroom and barley “sausage” roll. Croissants are to die for. And of course there are various cakes, bread and coffee. And a great place to stop before you catch a train. Just go up the stairs a little beyond the shop. ",21/04/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Jenny W,Auchencairn,5,Delicious ,"With an hour to kill between trains I looked on Tripadvisor and went here for breakfast I don’t know the area and struggled a bit to find it you come out of the station: and go left and down some metal steps it’s in an old railway arch there’s a sign it’s only a couple of minutes walk. It’s definitely worth it, everything looked so delicious it was hard to choose what to have croissant muffins cakes, friendly staff warm and plenty of places to sit so so much better than the food offered at the station. ",02/04/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Enilaup,Great Malvern,4,Little gem,"Harts bakery was reviewed in the weekend food section of the papers and as I was passing through Bristol Temple Meads for work yesterday I thought I would check it out. I'm so glad that I did. 
If you take a few minutes to find this place you won't be disapointed and a nice change from all the usual station eateries.
I only had a take out coffee and cheese and jalapeño muffin, both of which were delicious. There was a tempting display of cakes, pastries and bread on display all a bit different.
A busy open plan kitchen and cafe makes this place buzzy and busy.
I would recommend.",05/03/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,TravelingJo,,4,Nice bakery-staff could be a bit more friendly,lovely pastries to take away. Will return. Staff not very friendly or polite/welcoming. I get it's a very busy bakery but a cheerful hello would make a big difference. The other customers were more friendly than the staff.,01/03/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,RavaraMike,Belfast,5,Makes Temple Meads almost worth using.,"I loved my lunch at Harts Bakery so much. It’s the first decent meal and coffee I’ve ever had at Temple Meads station (a food lover’s nightmare) next time you stand despairing outside the station’s main entrance spin 180 walk diagonally left through the car park. Take the metal steps down, look right and you’ve found Harts. Brilliant food and welcoming staff. Enjoy!!",28/02/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Peter D,Saltford,5,Lovely start to our day,Excellent coffee and cakes. We still have not been able to sample their bacon butties or cinnamon buns as the are always sold out quickly.  Maybe one day...,14/02/2019
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Tommy,,5,Best bakery I can remember ,"Excellent food. Great coffee. Fast friendly service. Lovely atmosphere. And to top it all off, inexpensive. I’d journey to Bristol simply to get a coffee and my breakfast. Yum. ",01/02/2019

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Paul H,Huddersfield,5,Top bakery,"Harts bakery is really fantastic. Huge warm room. The sausage rolls are the best I've ever tasted.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,One_of_the_BOFs,Cheltenham,5,Hidden gem of a bakery/cafe,"I chose this place to get a pre-return train snack for my son and myself after a beery overnight stay in town - what a great find! It was a real ‘wow’ moment when I walked in and saw what was hidden in the railway arch.  I chose macaroni cheese pasties (neither of us eat meat) and granola bars, both of which were deliciously tasty.
Definitely a place for future return visits.",27/12/2018
Hart's Bakery,4.5,EmmaBowler,Exeter,5,Gorgeous food with a great atmosphere and level access,"This fabulous bakery is near Temple Meads train station, when I first tried to find it I couldn't but when I returned to Bristol I was determined and it was worth it!  

[To find it you walk away from the station out of the main entrance, at the end of the road turn left and double back on yourself down that road which is a car park, the bakery is at the end of the road on the left].

I had the vegetarian lunch slice which had leeks in it, I can't remember the full description but it was SO tasty.  So often vegetarian food is a disappointment but this wasn't.

I also shared a peanut brownie with my friend and this was lovely and moist and nutty!

I enjoyed a loaf of the rosemary and kalamata olive sourdough back at home and wished we had this place down the road from me!

Disability access-wise - there's level access into the bakery and the tables have moveable benches but I don't think there are any toilets. We shared a table with a couple of very friendly women and the atmosphere and service was fun and friendly.",17/12/2018
Hart's Bakery,4.5,TartanHornplayer,London,5,Definitely lives up to the hype!,"Many Bristolian friends had told me this was THE place for coffee - they were not wrong!  Sadly, I was several hours too late for the much-hyped Cinnamon Buns, but the carrot cake was sublime, as was the cheesy flamiche (sp?!).  Really good coffee too, and wonderful to see a working bakery close up.  Will be back whenever I'm in the city from now on.",01/12/2018

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Zara,,5,Wonderful,"In hart's bakery, I feel at home. Everybody's lovely, the food is sublime. I could not wish for anywhere better. However, the place is so good that it is often very busy. Its great for gluten free people but they can't classify it as ""gluten free"" but I'v never had a problem.",21/11/2018
Hart's Bakery,4.5,815dirt,London,4,"Great for dine-in, NOT GOOD for takeaway ","Hart’s is a great little bakery-come-cafe. The freshly baked food is fantastic (especially the mushroom and barley rolls) and the service is friendly. However, there’s no differentiation between the dine-in and takeaway process, so the wait for a takeaway coffee can be long! Took over 10mins to get a coffee (which I hadn’t allowed for, I admit) so despite paying for, had to leave without it.

Will definitely be back - but dining in!  ",17/11/2018
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Jane,Birmingham,4,Coffee,"Dropped in for a quick coffee and pastry. Wonderful little cafe/bakery under the arches by the train station.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Hyoga83,Bordeaux,5,Amazing,"I live in France so I am acquainted with amazing bread and pastries; that is why I was extremely impressed by the quality, variety and taste of the produce in Hart's Bakery. We had pastries for breakfast but I couldn't resist a freshly cooked bacon and cheese muffin they had just taken out of the oven! We took a big bread and it was extremely good, also.
To make things better it is right beside the train station.",30/10/2018
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Hugo,Gateshead,4,Cute quirky coffee and pastries ,"A good friend recommended I drop in here before getting a train. Totally on premises made food.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Kensingtonfoodiegirl,London,4,"Good coffee, but don’t go there if you are in a rush ","Make sure you have enough time left in case you have to catch a train. We waited 5min in line and another 5min for our coffees. To be fair, it’s a busy/popular place, but then you might have to organise the coffee bar a bit more efficiently or get more staff to make sure clients aren’t waiting for sooo long. 

The coffee was good and apparently it is the only decent coffee place close to Bristol Temple Meads station, but still no excuse to let everyone wait for so long.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,AnanB,Bristol,5,Fantastic pastries and cakes,"On our way to London we stopped in to get breakfast for the train.

The queue, as always was long even though it was 8am on a saturday. I had a cheese toastie which was so good but very filling. Nephew had a cinnamon roll which is his favourite and he enjoyed it. We also had a slice of chocolate cake for the afternoon which was superb.

All in all, definitely worth the wait.",16/08/2018

Hart's Bakery,4.5,cremsal,,5,Best bakery in Bristol,This unassuming bakery is tucked away beneath the Temple Mead arches but it really is a hidden gem.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,BristolBuzzing,London,4,Such a treat under the station,"Returning twice this last month to this fantastic cafe. Can’t stay away, any excuse!
 They have had a make over and it looks like a extension of premises in the arches under the station. But this only enhances the joyous place. It is a real pleasure to sit and watch the world go by, embrace the joy of the staff that work here. In addition to excellent ‘on the go’ food, wonderful lunches and to top it all delightful vases of fresh garden flowers on the tables. Bought the rye bread which was the best I’m ever eaten.",18/07/2018

All the products look fantastic and taste really nice. Its not the cheapest with cakes starting c£1.80 but more commonly £2+ but was a really nice treat. We chose a selection of cakes for my daughters birthday treat [7 = £17.50) and all were really nice with quality ingredients.

Service was very good and they had a great knowledge of their products.",06/07/2018

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Sharonfv,Greater London,5,WOW!! Wish I'd been able to try everything they made,"Some places made an impression when you walk in and this cafe certainly did.
I was recommended to go there for a coffee by an Uber driver.  I must admit I'm a very fussy coffee drinker and expect the highest standards and this cafe served me a coffee to be proud of.
The whole bakery is on show and you can see and hear that the staff are proud and happy to work there.  The smell is amazing. One woman told me their sourdough is the best I would ever eat.  Their cookies, bars and breads all look amazing!!! I did buy a loaf to take home which is now in the freezer ready to eat.
Outdoor seating too.
Thank you Mr Uber driver - no I wasn't disappointed.",24/06/2018

Hart's Bakery,4.5,gilesd007,Bristol,3,I really wanted to love this place but...,"I read the TripAdvisor reviews, then went to Temple Meads especially, down the hard to navigate steps ad found the place...not easy to find.

I've been there a couple of times, but the conclusion was the food just wasn't nice.

The feeling of the place, with it being underground, fresh baked food and each piece coming out of the oven looked stunning.

The problem is that it looked better than what it tasted (had a mince pie, cakes, sandwich in the 4 times I visited).  There wasn't much flavour to it, the ingredients were basic and it's expensive.

I really, really wanted to enjoy this food but after trying it and realising that it's nothing special - I won't be back :(",26/04/2018
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Nicos Tan,London,5,One of the best places for sausage roll,"Apart from the sausage roll we had in a small time in Northampton wellingborough this is amazing. Freshly made and speedy service. Do be careful of parking in only lot 42 to 45 if you ever do drive as that area is a private property. Lots of roadworks now but just be sure to turn left, right after temple meads station and go straight. 
Dessert is alright, but I guess the main attraction is still the sausage roll.",29/03/2018

As soon as you enter, the smell of beautiful baking hits you, and you can look towards the back of the cafe and see the baking being done.

Beautiful unpretentious, tasty and nourishing food at very reasonable prices with a real 'community' atmosphere.

Prices quoted tend to be eating in so are cheaper if you takeaway - the bread pudding was delicious and they were extremely busy today as it was Bristol University open day so it was extremely busy with prospective students as well as returning students

This place produces food with flavour and imagination and has a basic but cosy environment.  The veggie roll that I had was absolutely stunning, loads of flavour, perfect light pastry and my only regret was that there was only time for a short visit.  I regulary visit or pass through Bristol so along with one or two of my favourite pubs this will be a must visit.",17/08/2017
Hart's Bakery,4.5,McCLg1962,Herefordshire,5,Breakfast ,"Like most people I found Hart's Bakery part by chance and part by ruthlessly interrogating a work colleague, who kept arriving in our office with the most fantastic pastries. It's located in the arches beneath the access road for Temple Meads station, and can be a little hard to find the first time but you will be glad you made the effort. 
The smell that embraces you as you walk in the door is wonderful, freshly brewed coffee mixes with the wafting aroma of cinnamon to form an almost soporific atmosphere that was very relaxing, especially after commuting into Bristol on an overcrowded train. The selection of pastries and rolls is mouthwatering, pain au raison, cinnamon buns, breakfast muffins you could spend ten minutes just making your mind up. The staff are cool, hard working with a sense of fun and are all extremely passionate about what they do. 
So make the time to sit down with a coffee and a pastry and savour the atmosphere. 
You'll be glad you did.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,David M,Taunton,5,Worth a detour to get to ,Hidden gem can be overused as a term but this is one of them. It's a proper craft bakery with an eye on taste and excellence. It's the opposite of a large chain bakery that uses cheap ingredients to try and grab high margins. This place is serious of the highest quality baking and offers fantastic snack or lunch options as well as delicious loaves of sourdough or whatever grabs your fancy.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Soph D,United Kingdom,3,Just average...,"Went here on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Bristol and having looked at the good reviews on Google. The photos and website showed all kinds of tasty offerings from freshly prepared pastries, breads and cakes to coffee and lunches. Unfortunately I came away feeling fairly underwhelmed. There was relatively little in the range of choice, the only fresh bread they had for sale were rye sourdoughs and so had to settle for a loaf baked the previous day which I later regretted as it was rock hard. Also bought a ginger 'biscuit' for £1.80 (more like a cookie) which was very hard and dry rather than crisp. Flavour was not the best either; not really sweet enough for a biscuit and had quite a harsh taste of powdered ginger which stuck for a while. To be fair I did go around 2:30pm (half an hour before close) and as with most bakeries, the best stuff has been and gone by the end of morning so the limited range I saw may not be truly representative. Having said that, all the available counter space was filled (which wasn't that much coverage) but only with brownie/granola type bars. Overall, I don't see what the hype is with this place. In most conurbations there are at least a handful of independent bakeries and this one doesn't really stand out as anything beyond the ordinary. ",28/04/2017
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Eloïse P,,5,Best bakery,"Went there after arriving at Bristol to take a breakfast, I really really enjoyed the place. Living in England since August 2016 I really miss French food, and this bakery gave me the impression to be in France and to eat a traditional French ""pain au chocolat"".

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Ian F,,5,A bit of a phenomenon,"If you love sourdough bread then you will probably want to be living near to Temple Meads - so you can get to Harts before they sell out. If you haven't tried sourdough, then you should: it's wonderful and I, for one, have not tasted better anywhere. But there's more to Hart's than a sourdough bakery located in the arches under the approach to Temple Meads station. Their lunches are inventive and wonderfully tasty and, though they often sell out quite early (when I've arrived after 1pm they've sold out) you can usually get a sourdough toastie which is still brilliant and I can also recommend the sausage rolls, quiches and cakes (I've just eaten a piece of carrot cake with a pumpkin seed (I think!) brittle topping, which was delish). Accommodation for eating-in is limited to a few basic bench seats (many people seem to take away) and it gets very busy at lunchtime but its all very friendly. This place buzzes - a great filip for oldies like me!",07/04/2017
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Blackth0rn,Bristol,5,Absolutely delicious!,"Not somewhere you’re going to stumble across my accident, this is hidden away in the arches beneath the approach to Temple Meads station, but nonetheless it’s a popular spot and there is usually a queue of people waiting to be served whenever I have visited. A tempting array of wares is laid out on front of you as you queue, which is great perhaps for perusing what’s on offer, but personally I’d prefer the food to be covered or a little further away from people breathing all over it. It really is right in front of you, and you even have to lean over everything to pay. A couple of blackboards also listed the day’s specials. Seating is limited and mostly communal benches, plus a few outside tables ready for the warmer weather.

I opted for a mushroom and cheese tart, and this was very good indeed, very tasty and quite delicious. Across the table a pork and leek sausage roll was also very well received, apparently being the best sausage roll my wife had ever had. Quite a compliment, but it reminded me of a friend’s visit a few months ago when he considered one of their pies to be the best he’d ever had. A sticky toffee pudding muffin was perhaps slightly less successful – still pretty good, but what appeared to be oodles of toffee sauce around the top was just that – a bit around the top, but nowhere else. It was also somewhat denser than I’d have liked, and a bit heavy on the dates, but I’m sure that’s all just personal preference.

All in all, a great establishment and well worth seeking out.",07/04/2017

The baking takes place at the back of the venue, so you can see it all happening. The cakes and toasties are so good (and often sell out) so make sure you get there early to avoid disappointment. The Saturday bread should get a special mention as it is amazing. It's a mixture of a doughnut and a cake with a sticky toffee sauce at the bottom. It's as good as it sounds!

The coffee was great and as for food, I ordered the sourdough toastie - a tasty morsel of cheddar cheese, mustard and spring onion. The experience of eating this melted cheese sandwich on the train platform will remain with me for a long time. The combination of flavours was just spot on.
Will definitely be picking up a loaf of their sourdough bread when next in Bristol.",11/01/2017

The staff made no attempt to gretet us or ask us what we wanted and when I asked if something was gluten free, they told me to read the label! (Label not on product which was why I asked).

I couldn't believe how rude they were. The food seemed run of the mill bakery ware to us and very overpriced. However, our trip was tainted by the service we received so early on in our day away with the family.
We ordered coffe each and a pastry, coffee cold and the pastry was ok. 
I wouldn't recommend and will never return.

I hope management reads this in the hope that the customer service improves.",13/09/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Seth J,London,5,Everything is excellent,"Have been at various times of the day on various days. Almost everything I've tried is delicious and their gluten free brownies are not only the best gluten free brownies I've had, they're also some of the best brownies I've had.",07/09/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,BigKevTravels,Bristol,5,Superb bakery,This brilliant independent bakery is in the arches underneath Temple Meads. The coffee is fantastic and the range of pastries outstanding. Make sure you visit-it deserves support.,28/08/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Pete R,Bristol,5,A hidden gem - worth the walk!,"This little bakery tucked away under the car park for Bristol Temple Meads is definitely one of Bristol's hidden gems! I've been a long term fan, as has my wife, but this time we brought my mother in law and 2 dogs.

You wouldn't hear this said about many eating establishments, but the sausage rolls are out of this world! Both the meat and veggie options are always so interesting flavours - I think mine was pork, orange and fennel. Instead of our usual coffee we went for the home made elderflower which was perfect on a hot Summer's day. Finally we had a brownie and a raspberry & coconut slice - 2 reliably great options which didn't disappoint.

They do of course make some incredible breads too. Though we didn't eat any on this visit, I love the smell of it and just being able to watch the process unfold before you as you eat is a rare pleasure.

A special mention here for the staff who were really accommodating of our dogs (possibly as we went during a quiet period: 11-12 on a Wednesday morning), but they let us bring them inside and provided a water bowl. Thanks!",27/08/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Jonas T,,5,Step into the past,Hart's Bakery is a pace one has to experience. It is like stepping into the 19th century. The only thing that gives it away is that it is a modern bakery ;),23/08/2016

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Karen C,Staffordshire,5,What a gem,"This had to be a place for the locals, no tourists could find it, I'm sure. Luckily, a tour guide we spoke to in the street, told us about it. It was packed with little room to move, which normally would put me off, but we moved quickly to be served and the smells, atmosphere and friendly banter were intoxicating. The staff never stopped, whether they were making the fabulous food, serving or the lovely, jovial, friendly guy clearing the tables. The food was wonderful, tasty and fresh and the style of the seating made it impossible not to talk to fellow customers. Lovely, wonderful place and the best sausage rolls I have ever eaten-I highly recommend you to go.",04/08/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Paul T,Kendal,4,Breakfast stop,Super pastries. Love to see this type of business. Only wish I had some space in my bags for some of the loaves and cakes that were available. Good Americano too.,28/07/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,ninepine,Banstead,4,Worth tracking down under the station,"Underneath the ramp up to Bristol Temple Meads station Hart's can't be seen from the main station entrance but is well worth finding. I visited on Saturday afternoon before it closed for Sunday and Monday. 

There was still a good selection of tasty pastries and savouries. A sausage roll and Aloo Gobi pasty provided a filling lunch. The coffee was good and there is free water on tap. 

If you're near Bristol Temple Meads station (and it is the home of what is probably the world's first purpose built Railway terminus) and need good bakery food then this is the place. ",25/07/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,TwometrePete,Bristol,5,Great place for coffee or lunch,"Tucked away underneath the approach, this is the place to get great coffee & freshly cooked bread, cakes and savouries!  Buzzing with locals 'in the know' plus 'randoms' who've just discovered.

Everything about this place is superb from the best bread you'll find in Bristol (although Mark's Bread in Bedminster is also equally excellent) to the myriad cakes, pasties and lunch items, to the helpful and friendly staff. Fair warning, this place gets super busy during lunchtime but the line moves swiftly so you'll never have to wait too long.",14/07/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Briony P,,5,Good Loaf wins the prize!,"I pop in here regularly to pick up a Good Loaf and a gluten free brownie. The good loaf is cooked without any gluten containing ingredients and is absolutely delicious - it's a dense, nutty, seedy, moist and flavour-filled delight! So so good with some humous for lunch. The brownies are also cooked without gluten ingredients and change periodically - from walnuts (my favourite) to raspberries to cheesecake topping. All really rather yummy and highly recommended - a great pit stop on the way to the train!",14/07/2016

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Anne D,Bristol,5,Worth catching a train for!,"If you need to be at Templemeads station for any reason whatsoever a visit to Harts bakery is a MUST. A hive of activity. Baking continually happening. Customers dropping in for delicious food and drinks as sit in or take away. We actually caught the train from Severn Beach to Templemeads (a real gem of a service) just to have 'elevensies'. Excellent coffee. Pork and black pudding sausage roll with the best flaky pastry I've ever had, buttery, melt in the mouth! A coconut slice that was light and crumbly. I think what ever you chose to eat you'd be looking at the person next to you wishing you could eat that too! We caught the water taxi from the station to the city centre for a wander. On the journey back we bought 4 more of those sausage rolls. Two for friends and 2 for us. Much to my disgust my husband!s son called round and he was given both of these to try. Oh well there's always another day and the chance for another visit. Absolutely no hardship there then.",25/06/2016

The cinnamon buns.

Just wow. 

Absolutely one of the best things I've ever eaten. So delicious I'm salivating writing this review they were that good. 

I'm not from Bristol but I'm seriously considering moving there now if the food is that good, the coffee was very tasty too. 

The bakery and table space is also a great touch, lots of original features from the railway days and it all works beautifully together.",18/05/2016
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Onevanandhisdog,,5,The best raspberry bakewell in the world. Fact.,"Bristol is deservedly getting a reputation for being a city for foodies. Hart's is without doubt bolstering that reputation with gusto.

Once found, hidden away in an arch under the entrance way to the station you will see a small army of bakers industriously magicking a veritable array of cakes and savoury treats. The savoury numbers come in vegetarian and meaty. The pasties in all sorts of fillings - chicken to cauliflower. Yet every time it is the lightness and shortness of the pastry that so wonderfully completes it - calories be damned. (Especially if you go for the cheese toastie which is such good value and flavour!)

The crown has to go to the raspberry bakewell with its perfect pastry case, chunks of raspberry in a jammy goo trapped beneath that almondy sponge that is just a treat for the tonsils.

The bread they keep simple. All sourdoughs. The white being their flagship is crisp and mature in its flavour and texture. Next day it's also great for toast. I've not thrown any bread away yet.

Hart's arguably is the best bakery in town, yet what I also love about them the most is that it isn't always perfect. A loaf can occasionally not be 100% or a cake might not quite hit the mark. This is what makes it great - it provides evidence of it's beating heart of artisanal passion working away through the night to get it all made on time. Experiencing occasional flaws evidences Hart's DNA in everything that is handmade there in that little arch under Temple Meads station.  

So thank you you bakers for getting up so damn early in the morning to make sure that bread is there for us lazy sods that don't get up until daylight. And thank you to the baker that makes the best raspberry bakewell in the world. Thank you.",17/05/2016

Also bought a loaf of sourdough bread (it is the best bread I have had in this country - I am French, love my bread and it is great - go and buy some!). The croissants and pain au chocolat were a bit overcooked but it did not detract from the glorious flavour. The coffee took an age to get to us but it was great. It was really really busy - at one point, the queue was out of the door and the person who was sitting next to us said that it normally does not take that long to get a drink. Overall, really enjoyed it and will be back.

They have a small selection of hot specials on the day but a large selection of breads, cakes etc to suit all tastes and budgets. Its all open plan so you can watch everything being prepared and going into the ovens, the furniture is functional and quite industrial but comfortable enough.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Aunty B,Bristol,5,A favourite destination for Bristol foodies,"Here is the source of the bread by which I judge all others! The white sour dough is a baking tour de force. Great crispy crust with a great tasting chewy mie (the fleshy centre). We love it fresh in a sandwich or older for toast, bruschetta and pan con tomate. The fennel & raisin bread has a delightful balance of aniseed and fruit. The savories are wholesome without that rancid greasiness of lesser bakers. The morning bread is a gooey delight. The biggest challenge when coming here for breakfast, lunch or just to buy for home is what not to have! It's all so good. I haven't even begun to tell you about the custard tarts!

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Ed,Brighton,5,Hidden gem,"We had read great things about this place and when visiting Bristol over the weekend decided to hunt it out! It's not the easiest thing to find but well worth a visit. 

Situated in n arch under the train station, this place compromises of a few tables at the front with an open bakery at the back. We had a couple of gorgeous sausage rolls and shared some cookies but could have eaten everything from the display! The staff were warm and friendly and it was great value too. 

Perfect for a pit stop",30/08/2015
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Nafus1,Wilmington,5,Tucked away place near the train station,"My daughter took my wife and I to Hart's Bakery.  This is a place you would never run into by accident. Actually I never saw it until I was standing directly in front of it.  But believe me the locals knew where it was so it had to have great food. It did.

Mostly the main food was sausage rolls and pasties.  For those of you from other places pasties are like turnovers.  The pasties had potatoes and cheese and lamb with some veggies.  The sausage rolls were large and delicious.

Included are photos of the bakery front entrance, the inside, a plate of sausage rolls and potato cheese pasty and the deserts.  

There are a few tables to sit but most patrons did take away.

The staff was helpful and quick to provide service.  Overall it was an excellent experience.  GO!",28/08/2015

Embrace it for what it is, which is a charismatic bakery offering fabulous quality products. The staff work tirelessly to bake and serve you with a honest smile and are a great team.

As a result this is exceptional value too.

It's packed for a reason! People vote with their feet.

The first thing that strikes you as you enter the bakery is the atmosphere, the hustle & bustle and energy the place has, it's a real 'work place' as well as a place to eat.
The food, sweet or savoury is just delicious....if you visit around lunchtime, try the soup, it comes with some great bread. But don't go without tasting one of their pastries.

The coffee is not made as you order and there was one man trying to make coffee for everyone.We started to eat our pain au chocolate  whilst we waited for our coffees.They were dry and didn't have much chocolate ( we ended up leaving most of them ,) eventually after about 10 mins ,and after our coffees were offered to a table of other people with the waitress stating loudly they moved! as the people said the coffees weren't theirs (we hadn't moved at all!!) our drinks arrived.The coffees were good but we'd waited so long by then that we had to drink down quickly and head for the train.I will not be returning there are better alternatives to what seemed to me a chaotic cafe .If you do go there there's a metal stairs just beyond the cafe which will take you up to the station which is useful",07/07/2015

So many good things to pick from so I'll give you a few of the yummier options.
- Cinnamon buns
- Egg and bacon muffin
- Raspberry and vanilla jam on toast
- Chocolate fudge cake
- Chocolate and walnut brownies
- Chocolate chip cookies

They also do specials at lunch times [Friday specials are the best but get there early to avoid disappointment]. Some to watch out for if they have them: Chorizo stew; Meatloaf sandwich; anything that has homemade onion rings in... you know what... there are too many to list.

Every time someone asks me how I'm enjoying Bristol I start every answer with ""Oh my god I'm eating so much baked stuff from this great little bakery round the corner from work.""

There's so much variety and everything is beautifully presented and looks delicious. We had the chocolate fudge cake with cashew brittle, a coconut macaroon and a piece of shortbread and they were all fantastic and well-priced.

But when we saw the food on offer we decided to stay for a simple lunch.  I had the best Gazpacho I have ever tasted anywhere in the world - was the secret ingredient sun dried baby tomatoes marinated in olive oil?   Whatever, it was delicious and served at the correct temperature with sour bread and a huge smile.   My husband had a very good pea, mint and feta cheese tart.   We both had excellent Americano coffees and we took home two generous slices of carrot and walnut cake - one of which we have just eaten and enjoyed.  It was very succulent with delicious icing.

Laura & her staff had set everything up when we arrived Saturday evening & all we had to do was make the different foods & no washing up. Brilliant.

We ate our hot croissants etc & went home with huge goodie boxes. Great baking weekend

Hart's Bakery,4.5,IndianVerbena,Sheffield,3,Mixed feelings,"After reading all the good reviews I was keen to visit Harts Bakery.

To start with positives, it looked really busy on a Saturday morning, a good sign. The rosemary and olive bread we had later with dinner was tasty.
The shortbread was yum yum and I would buy it again.

Unfortunately the almond croissant had no almond paste? I was a little confused as to whether they just topped it with flaked almonds and voila. The pain au chocolate was equally disappointing, the pastry was dry and the chocolate was still tubular and just not great.
My other half also added the sausage roll wasn't a great deal to shout about.

But, in recent times the quality of the food has not been as good as it was and the staff at the moment are almost to the point rude.
it is a real shame that these areas have been compromised as it had such promise. There is a lot of hype but to be honest there are plenty cafes and bakeries in bristol that are as good if not much better.

It's a never ending cycle of visits to Hart's bakery! which is no more than they deserve frankly for a string of new ideas that feel like they're made by someone who really loves what they do. I've read some of the average reviews and so what if every pasty isn't a world beater? Many are and they're all inventive. So once one of the ace sausage rolls had too much fennel, sourdough bread has a crust and everything isn't hermetically sealed in plastic. People like you lot should go to Greggs end eat some generic paste, at least it'll keep you quiet for 99p. ",11/02/2015

Well today I had the sausage roll. Best £2.80 I've spent for ages. 
Fluffy crisp pastry. Lots of meat, delicately seasoned with a hint of heat. It was, frankly, bloody delightful. 
Next time I'm anywhere near Temple Meads I'm going to have another. Will probably try the coffee too. 
As an aside, the location is quite fascinating. A tunnel under the approach to Temple Meads Station. A few tables for dining in with a nice rustic feel.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Kenneth M,Oxfordshire,5,A sheer pleasure for a Sour Dough Fan like me plus more.,"It seems everytime I visit Bristol these days from Oxford there are two places that are a must for me this time in the morning of the 17th December   The first is Harts Bakery just at the side of Temple Meads incline and the other is the Pieminister in Stokes Croft.  My visit on the 17th December was a delight once again, superb coffee excellent choice of pastries etc for mid morning, I was sorry that once again I missed the Bacon Butties which are to die for, however I did manage to get a number of the Sour Dough Loaves which are truly superb and as good as any in San Francisco, plus a lot more varieties.  As usual I bought a number of each for my wife and I as well as for our daughter and her family.  The bread freezes without problem and also toasted it is from frozen it is again a delight to be enjoyed.   Croissants were again another purchase and above all the very pleasant staff and rapid service makes the trip all the more pleasant, plus being able to park right outside if you are careful is another bonus.
I did revisit later in the day to take advantage also of their pasties both vegetarian and meat which again are superb.
I cannot say too much about this venue other than it is exceptional and the only reason I have not given it a best meal I have ever had is because it was more a snack than a meal but was nonetheless fantastic.   Be aware that they are not open on Mondays.",10/01/2015

Hart's Bakery,4.5,John O,Ilfracombe,3,Dissappointed :(,"Visited at approximately 10.30 on a Saturday.  Expecting a nice selection of breads and pastries as was advertised on their website.  Unfortunately they had no pastries whatsoever and had apparently sold out of croissants.

The bakery is small and has a lot of seating at the front which meant that the place was very crowded.  The queue was backed up to the door and you could not see any of what was on offer while waiting.  There was a total of four breads, all sourdough.

We ordered two cake pieces, a cookie and a sourdough.  The person serving was very pleasant but forgot to get us one of the pieces of cake we ordered.  We only realised when we got home and there was no receipt to check what we had been charged for. £9.45 for a cookie, a piece of cake and a loaf of bread seems quite steep though.

We left feeling that this was more of an artisan coffee shop than a bakery and with such a small selection of breads and pastries we will unlikely be visiting again.

Upon tasting the food, I can't say that it was really anything special.  The bread was good, as was the cake, but nothing to write home about, and the cookie was probably not as good as the ones you get in cafe Nero (which can't be a good thing).

I would like to say more positive things about this place but apart from the fact it is an independent bakery/coffee shop that seems to be doing well my partner and I left feeling quite deflated.",11/10/2014

 Super coffee, roasted by Extract. Friendly staff! Lovely benches to sit at but I would definitely recommend visiting early to ensure pastry availability. My new favourite in Bristol.",09/10/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Happy Eater,,3,Food good.  Coffee not,We came here for a takeaway breakfast and the food was very good. Unfortunately the coffee was barely lukewarm and the person serving the drinks was so abrupt she was verging on rude. Will come for food again but I'm not sure I would bother with the coffee again. ,08/10/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Jenno98,London,4,Quick Bite,Brilliant for a quick bite. Unforunately we managed to get there at 2pm on a Saturday which is an hour before closing. So there wasn't much of a choice. But the black pudding sausage roll and the minted lamb pasty were very tasty. My boyfriend bought some shortbread to take away and the coffee is decent. Worth a visit. Wish I could of tried the cinnamon buns!,01/10/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Sue T,Brent Knoll,4,Disappointing coffee,"Loved the food: banana and toffee cake, chocolate and nuts but the coffee was disappointing.  My husband had a latte and I a cappuccino but both were warm - not hot and for some unknown reason mine was 2/3rds the size of the latte but was the same price.  The bread looked lovely and the service was good its just the coffee that now needs to be sorted as we noticed a lot of people drinking theirs very quickly as well.",26/09/2014

Hart's Bakery,4.5,AnneKelly,,5,a little culinary gem in Bristol,"over a period of a week we visited the bakery on 4 occasions, including breakfast and lunch on the same day. It produces freshly baked products to a high standard, both savoury and sweet. their sausage rolls, pasties and filled croissants are as good as you will get anywhere, with imaginative variations on the fillings and there is always a lunch time special for about a fiver. The pastries too have a little extra twist and the coffee is excellent. You can sit and watch these artisan bakers in full flow just a few feet away. It is situated just below and to the right of the entrance to Temple Meads station, in the arches under the road up to the station, a little distance from the centre but easily reached.",22/09/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,MarcelaPomphrey,Bristol,5,oh so cool! stop displaying all those cakes!,"I visited for the first time today and I am hooked. The place has such a great vibe!
People just come and sit, have a lunch, talk, hang out and go back to their offices. I tried the pea and mint tartlet, my husband had a chicken and ham pasty.
I had one of those cheeky nut and dried fruit bars, they taste perfect!
I love watching people making cakes, bread, cleaning up, just beavering away. This place has got it soo right!
I will be coming back :)",19/09/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Ruth13Rich,Taunton,5,Amazing,"Day tripped to Bristol and feeling a bit peckish, we came across this Bakery. I can't review it highly enough. The food we had was lovely.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,David Wragg,Bristol,3,Mmmmmm,Lovely food and really lovely friendly staff . But why oh why is the food left out exposed all day. What is wrong with covering your food up. Surely you cannot get a good food hygiene rating for leaving the food uncovered all day .,15/09/2014

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Richard J,Bristol,5,Brilliant breakfast,I visited Hart's after reading that it was one of the top places to go in the Naked Guide to Bristol Best Breakfast Guide. It doesn't offer a traditional fry-up but specialises in pastries which are outstanding. The coffee is excellent as well. A worthy top-billing in the excellent Naked Guide to Bristol.,01/09/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,TravellingHannah,London,5,Fantastic lunch,"Hidden down a side road by the station Hart's Bakery is definitely worth seeking out. We went for Saturday lunch and enjoyed a tasty pork sausage roll with very flaky pastry and a white onion, cheese and thyme pie with melt-in-the mouth pastry. Very good value for money. We sat on the stools and enjoyed a cup of tea and elderflower cordial with our food whilst watching the staff bake cookies and more sausage rolls.

Make sure you check the opening times (Tuesday to Saturday 7:00am to 3:00pm) to avoid disappointment.",24/08/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Sam A,Trowbridge,5,Fab place to hang out,"It is a little difficult to find this if you don't know bristol well.  When you do find it, it is so worth it.  I have tried quite a few of the cakes and the awesome cheese toastie.  Its lucky i don't live nearby otherwise I would come in all the time.  The best is watching the bakers at work at the back of the store while drinking coffee and eating cake.  My fav cake is the sour cream slice.

Keep up the good work.",14/08/2014

Can't believe I didn't go before. It's going to become a regular haunt I feel so I can try the rest of the delicious looking stuff on offer ( a three bean pasty has to be next I think!)

Bought a sour dough loaf to take home as well. What's not to love?!",13/08/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Kenneth M,Oxfordshire,4,As a great fan of sour dough this was a breakfast treat.,"My cousin and I visited Harts Bakery after finding them closed a couple of weeks ago on a Monday and were pleased to find them open on Wednesday morning 6th July.   My regret is we arrived too late 10-30am for the Breakfast Muffin Sour Dough with egg and bacon.  However the offer of Cheese and Mushroom toasted Sour Dough was a brilliant alternative, all washed down with first class coffee.   There is seating provided and we were able to park very close to the bakery as well.   On offer also was a selection of at least 5 sour dough loaves for purchase, I chose one of each and also the huge croissants as well as a couple of apple cream slices.   Whilst I have not eaten all of these at this time the ones I have tried are tremendous.
Superlatives do little to describe exactly how good this bakery is but it does support what I said many years ago and since whilst visiting San Francisco and other parts of the States, that sour dough will be very successful in the UK once launched.   Also whilst the multiples supermarkets are not as good as the ones either in San Francisco or at Harts it shows there is a lot of new demand for this lovely bread once a poor offering for builders of the Sierra Railroad in the mountains and also for miners in California.   It has come a long way since.
This novel and original bakery is one which deserves to be one which is noted by the very discerning consumer of this type of bread.
Another note of history is that the very arch where the bakery is now placed was at one time the stables used to house the Rail horses for the Temple Meads railway etc. 
Also many thanks to our lovely Romanian waitress whose service for us was a delight from start to finish.",09/08/2014

I popped in on a friend's recommendation at lunch time, and enjoyed a delicious coffe and an incredible pasty - I think it was red lentil and spiced local sausage.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Jess,Edinburgh,5,Worth A Visit!,"I arrived in Bristol early one morning and told myself that my first stop in the city would be breakfast at Hart's Bakery. Upon entering the bakery, I wished I had a reason to buy one of their fresh loaves of bread because they looked (and smelled) great! But since I was only in town for a day, I had to settle for something else - a coffee and a pork sausage roll. The sausage roll was fantastic! It wasn't a plain pork filling, but rather the pork was spiced and herbed to give it some extra kick. The pastry was wonderfully flaky as well and the sausage roll was huge! It was too filling for me to be able to try one of their sweet treats, but if I'm ever in Bristol again, I'll be purposefully seeking out this bakery to try more of their offerings.",01/06/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Mrs White,Bristol,5,Wonderful!,"I always love going to Harts.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,SwordMaiden,Newton Abbot,5,Breakfast stop,"We were staying at The Ibis temple Meads but didn't fancy breakfast there. This place was recommended to us by a Bristolian and I can see why. Himself had two freshly baked croissants whilst I went for egg and bacon muffin. Very tasty and the other bread good on display looked wonderful.
Good cups of tea.

Head down from the station and you will see a metal staircase on the left taking you down to the Arches on that side. The bakery is tucked into one of the Arches and is a great little place to break your fast",24/05/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Becky.D,,5,Wonderful,"Lovely little bakery located just by Temple Meads Station. I have eaten here a couple of times at lunch time and it's always been lovely. The food is great quality and it tastes wonderful. It can be a little expensive, you're looking at about £15 for two pasties, two slices of cake and two cans of drink, but the quality of the food is worth it. A lovely place to stop for a quick pick me up.",13/05/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Philcat89,Preston,5,Hidden Gem,"We found this bakery by chance on our recent trip to Bristol, we were looking for somewhere to eat around the station and noticed a sign for it at the bottom of station approach, so curiosity got the better of us and we set off to try and find it.

The bakery itself is in one of the railway arches underneath the station approach so it's not easily seen from the road and if they didn't have the sign out you wouldn't know it existed.  We found it and because of its location we expected it to be fairly quiet.... How wrong we were!

The bakery itself is quite small but boy it's busy, whilst we were in there there was a constant steady stream of people coming and going.

We had lunch there on Saturday and we each had the cheese and mushroom toastie, a coffee and a slice of their delicious banana and toffee cake.

Everything was delicious and the service was friendly and quick. 

We would recommend this place to anyone and it is worth hunting out this little hidden gem!",19/04/2014

Hart's Bakery,4.5,mikvenn81,Bristol,5,"So it's not a Restaurant, but.....","This is a lovely gem in an unexpected place.  They make exceptional sourdough bread, delicious cakes and pastries, and every day have a number of savoury options for lunch.  

Some of the options are only available on certain days, I thoroughly recommend going on a Thursday or Friday for the Custard Tarts.  It is always worth going early, especially if you want bread or pastries, as they usually sell out.

I've been a few times and the service is always lovely, the lunch specials are wonderful and vary day to day, and the pasties are fab.  You can also opt for toasty made with house bread.

They serve Extract coffee and a number of different teas, all very carefully made.  There is a wide choice of cakes and sweet stuff.  The atmosphere is always lively, warm and welcoming.  

Worth a trip all on it's own, and certainly an essential stop if you are at the station anyway.",09/03/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Shrimpysmiles,Bristol,3,Not my cup of coffee,"Like so many others here, I visited on the strength of all the reviews but left a bit puzzled over them. Busy Saturday morning and praise has to be given to the professionalism of the serving staff. But my cappuccino was poor (and certainly not worth £2.20 for the size of it) and whilst the pain au chocolate was on the large side, it was cold and the chocolate inside hard. The breads did look good though.",01/03/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,craigodile,Perth,3,Not a bad bakery,"Another venue in Bristol that I don't really understand what the fuss about.

I use Temple Meads a lot so pop-in here on a semi-regular basis and was very surprised to see it's ranked number one for restaurants in Bristol.

I find the food a bit hit and miss. I've had an amazing pasty there one time (you could really taste the freshness of the ingredients), but the sausage rolls are consistently poor, in my opinion, with greasy pastry and over-powering seasoning (usually aniseed tasting) that detracts from the meat flavours. I also had some sort of egg/bacon (very fatty bacon) monstrosity that I couldn't finish.

The cakes look good and the bread is standard fare. It is pot-luck what will be available when you go in, mind, and the selection is often small.

The staff are friendly enough and the venue is open-plan so you can see the bakers at work.

It's nice enough and there's no harm in popping in if you're in the vicinity, but don't expect to be blown away.",27/02/2014

I also ordered a hot chocolate and a slice of carrot cake ( which was also delicious - there are many cakes to choose from it took me a while to make me decision) I would defiantly recomend this place for lunch or breakfast.

I was blown away at this great underground bunker and wondered why it had taken me so long to find it. A hive of activity with bakers producing fantastic bread and cakes and a great informal atmosphere perfectly suited to the setting. The cheese toastie is indeed superb and being fussy about coffee I'm not disappointed. I now love taking the train from TMs as it gives me the perfect excuse to arrive early!

As is the fashion, the cakes & pastries are displayed uncovered on a table, which customers queue beside to reach the till which is also amongst the goodies.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,DesiJeans,Bristol,4,Terrific Toasties!,We stopped at Hart's Bakery for breakfast before walking the Bristol to Bath Railway Path.  Both of us had the cheese toasties and were impressed (the fresh orange juice is also very good).  It's great to see the workings of the bakery in full view while purchasing your items.  The cafe was very popular and my only criticism would be that seating is limited and you may need to wait for a table to become available or order your goods to go.,21/01/2014
Hart's Bakery,4.5,MrBlackwell,Swindon,5,Sourdough worth travelling for!,"After becoming completely addicted to sourdough bread many years ago in San Francisco, I've never really been able to find any in the UK that compares... until recently.

A random Google search brought up Hart's one day and I vowed to give it a try then next time I was in Bristol. I'm glad I did. Their sourdough is just incredible. The taste, texture and quality, everything about it is just perfect. It would be quite possible to eat an entire loaf, without any butter or topping, in one sitting. It's that good.

I've since also tried a number of their cakes - including the amazing Almond pastry mince pies - and they're also faultless, but it's the sourdough I now make a point of picking up whenever I'm in Bristol (and, truth be told, it's what makes me look for excuses to go there).",20/01/2014

That bread though, their standard sourdough...it's remarkable. Truly remarkable.

Back in around 2011 when I first saw £3 next to a loaf of bread I thought...""Hmm, really?"" Now though, when it's sliced thick, toasted, buttered and marmaladed...it's stunning. Likewise with eggs on top, little chilli jam...it's to die for.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,CAFCBristol,Bristol,5,"Delicious, bread, cakes, savouries and coffee","Been here a few times now and it just gets better and better. Great bread, coffee, cakes, toasted sarnies, soup and savouries. Great atmosphere and staff that care about the people they're serving and the food that's on offer.

The sausage and apple roll this morning was divine; incredibly tasty and moist with a superb pastry covering. Once eaten you'll never want another warmed up frozen sausage roll again.

Food is prepared towards the back of their unit, which is in one of the arches under Bristol Temple Meads station, and it's just great to see the team preparing and cooking the various foods on offer. Only a small menu but spot on. It's a bakery after all and not a full restaurant. 

The bread on offer is various forms of sourdough and the toasted sarnies they make with it are delicious. Bread is also on sale and seems to be going out the door all the time. Just hope they can make enough to keep up with demand.

It's clearly a success story that Bristol should be proud of. 

Tip - if you want to sit and eat get there before 12.00 as it very quickly fills up and has a limited amount of seats. This is not a criticism as it's a bakery with seats as opposed to a cafe. However, you shouldn't have to wait long for a seat as there's a high turnover of people popping in for a coffee and cake etc. and who are not there for a long, leisurely lunch. 

Will I be going back. Yes, time and time again.",05/12/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Helen B,Bristol,5,Such lovely bread,"Bought myself a sausage roll and pastry here and picked up a few for the kids, they were delicious! So tasty I would highly recommend this Bakery to anyone looking to grab a quick snack.",04/12/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,HPS28,,5,Delicious food,"I had a almond croissant in an espresso bar and was so amazed by the croissant i asked where they got it from. The other couple in the bar had also been and insisted i visit as soon as possible. I was not disappointed, my husband and i have been most Saturdays since. There is normally a small queue (large after 10-10.30) but for good reason. The bread is excellent as are the pastries and 'Saturday bread' is also lovely. Not much seating so get there early if you want to enjoy some delicious coffee as well. The staff are friendly and efficient.",03/12/2013

Hart's Bakery,4.5,oaklandash,Sacramento,5,Bristol's Best Bakery,"During a two-month period in late 2013 I was on a work assignment in Bristol near the Temple Meads train station. During that time, I must have sampled Hart Bakery's lunch offerings and baked goods at least six times. I always ordered takeaway, but the vibe inside the bakery was always appealing and made me wish I had time for a sit down meal.
I found the food there to be delicious and creative. My favorites were the pasties, tarts, and brownies; not just any brownies...these had Earl Grey soaked prunes in them!
Truly delicious eats at this place and I highly recommend a visit if you're in Bristol.",02/12/2013

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Sarah,Bristol,5,Tasty and hearty,"I love the bustly welcoming vibe of this place, whether i'm grabbing something to take out, dining solo, or eating with friends, Hart's bakery hits the right notes everytime.
The delicious pasties are a meal in themselves, and i believe i've found my favourite and then i discover a new flavour- Like Coq au vin, or cauliflower cheese!
I can also recommend the variety of sausage rolls and the sourdough bread, not to mention the dozens of sweet treats.
I love the friendly atmosphere and open layout of Hart's, where you can see the pastries being made for yourself, and all the staff serve and chat...
Be warned once you have a taste of it you'll be back!",22/10/2013

Because if you do you might get there before me and buy all the delicious pastries, and then there will be none left for me, and I will have to hunt you down and mug you for your doughy goodness.

Amazing croissant and the best Danish I've eaten not only in Bristol but anywhere. 

Coffee is also excellent, and the pasties and other savoury things delicious too.

The staff are friendly, led by Laura Hart herself, and it's great to see them at work in the open plan bakery while you buy/eat.

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Claire H,Bristol,5,Loveharts,"Working in the area, colleagues had mentioned discovering this hidden gem but today, meeting two friends for a well ovedue catch-up, was the first visit I've made. Oh my God. Arriving half an hour early, the temptation to resist until the last friend turned up vanished literally minutes once we'd got inside. The display of cakes and savouries at the counter, together with the various loaves on offer, proved too much and we simply had to fill the time somehow! By the time she arrived, we were ready for seconds, and were still tempted to buy more to take-away a few hours later. Everything we had was divine, the staff are fantastically friendly, there was a steady stream of customers (some of whom are clearly regulars) whilst in the background a constant hive of activity by the bakers kneading dough and making pasties just added to the atmosphere. An absolute gem of a find - go there soon to find out why all the reviews are so good! I promise you'll go back time and again! We will!",27/09/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Catherine E,Bristol,5,Bakery best in Bristol. Coffee and snacks excellent,When hart's bakery was round the corner i put on half a stone. Now the walk there and back means i can indulge again. I was a desperate character waiting for the relocation. Back to happiness and satisfaction. Only trouble is getting purchases home without breaking into the bags and scoffing the lot. This is bakery as it should be and dream about. Thank you hart's. ,22/09/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Brizzley,,5,Wonderful,"What a find!

Hart's is tucked away to the right of the station approach as you come up the station in one of arches opposite the Bristol and Exeter House under the car park; in fact it is so tucked away that despite being a regular traveller I had missed it for almost a year after it arrived.

However, having found it I have enjoyed its fare regularly over the past fortnight.

It is an awesome bakers selling the most delicious fresh bread but strictly speaking this is a restaurant review so they also sell delicious cakes and coffee.

They serve a range of pastries, cakes and savouries all of which are fresh and great value. I would highly recommend looking out for it next time you are in the area.",14/09/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Big,Bristol,5,love Hart's,"I found Harts bakery almost by mistake really; I was searching for a supplier for a future enterprise and noticed they were supplying my competition so headed down to their site near Temple Meads station.

Hart's is a bakery but like most good bakeries they have set up somewhere you can also sample their wares pretty much as it comes out of the oven. A few rustic looking trestle tables and some retro chairs fill the entry to the bakery and are great places to sit and enjoy the food, great Extract Roasters Coffee and watch the world go by slowly outside and the the flurry of baking activity inside. 

The flurry of activity surrounds alchemic creations in each deck of their oven as they produce savoury sausage roles and pasties, alongside fantastic cakes - try the carrot and walnut its sublime. Although the custard tarts shouldn't go without a mention. 

The service is very good and the team seem genuinely nice too.",12/09/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,awfullybigadventure,,5,Fresh and flavoursome baked treats straight from the oven,"I was in here on a Saturday morning when I was staying at a nearby hotel. I had a cinnamon bun while I waited for my sourdough toast and homemade raspberry and vanilla jam. Both were just perfect. 

It was great being able to watch Laura Hart calmly and expertly mixing up the breads and cakes and pulling out fresh baked goods while we munched on our breakfast. There isn't much seating but there is a good flow of turnover so just be patient. The sour cream and apple cake was really original and I would have it again. I'll happily invent excuses to come to Bristol for this bakery again. Good value too and decent flat white.",08/09/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,Calzeh,Bristol,5,"Unpretentious, fantastic food.","I'm lucky to work at Temple Quay, as it means I can eat lunch here regularly. Harts fits all my requirements that food is fresh, good value and local, and that meat is ethically sourced. The preparation area is also very clean, and it is open so you can watch the bakers at work while you have a coffee. The staff are passionate about food and the menu changes daily, but I recommend the toasties, a Cornish pasty or a sausage roll. Things sell out quickly so it's best to arrive early, but there are usually at least toasties left over, and savoury goods tend to still come out of the oven until at least 1pm. Coffee here is also exceptional.

If you decide to eat in you'll probably have to share one of the long tables with other customers, however this is no bad thing and it adds to the very relaxed friendly atmosphere that the bakery has.

Definitely give it a go if you're in the area!",01/09/2013
Hart's Bakery,4.5,jojozara,,5,Outstanding,"I've eaten fantastic bread many times while travelling in Italy, France and Denmark but the sourdough from this bakery is the best I've ever tasted. (I noticed a stack of bags of flour in the kitchen - Shipton Mill Organic).

Hart's Bakery,4.5,Philip B,,5,What a find,"Don't go here for fine dining. Just go for the best sourdough bread,the tastiest sausage rolls and the most innovative cakes in Bristol .Pasties are really good and the sourdough cheese toasties look look brilliant.

Go early,they sell out quickly or phone your order ahead.  Staff are really friendly. If you are travelling from Temple Meads and want a snack don't buy in the station,go down the metal stairs right of the station and buy from the bakery.",24/08/2013

After my third, it was obvious this bakery cafe consistently produces some of the best products in England (best in Bristol) and the espresso (French style) was excellent.
Hart's bakes high quality bread and most enjoyable sweet and savoury delights. Quality ingredients, skill and a baker's love, gives results you will travel an awful long way to better. 
The pain chocolate and pain aux raison are in the world top 3 (the other two are in Paris [no surprise] and Canberra]. Forget that plastic wrap *rap in the supermarket and give yourself some Hart.",24/08/2013

Everything made there is fresh and delicious. The bakers really love bread and baking. They're passionate about what they are doing and this comes across in the food. This tiny bakery also bakes and delivers to some of Bristol's best coffeehouse but this is the source.

Not to be missed. A revelation. One of the best bakeries I have ever been to.",19/08/2013

Hart's Bakery,4.5,MiraE_12,Derby,5,Absolutely fantastic,"I had read about this bakery/cafe in Olive magazine and was visiting Bristol for the day (3 August 2013) so decided to visit. It's a little difficult to find, but persevere - it's worth it. 

I have visited hundreds of cafes and none of them compare to the quality of the produce served here. I had a coffee, which was really good - and shared a piece of the banana and toffee cake and the sour cream and apple cake. They were both absolutely stunning. They were so good, that I decided to buy one of the freshly baked pasties to take with me - aubergine, chickpea and tomato - it was also absolutely amazing.

The staff were very friendly. The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food. It's got a really nice atmosphere and you can watch the staff baking.

I can't praise it enough. Well done to the owner/staff - this is what every bakery/cafe should be like.",04/08/2013

The selection of cakes and gluten free vegan options are amazing (even though we aren't either). They literally cater for everyone and the price is so reasonable. We find cornish pasties anywhere else seem to be too seasoned or bland. If you visit Bude, this bakery is an absolute must. We even called on Friday on the way home to save eating rubbish food at the service stops. We will definitely be visiting again.",24/04/2022

Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,Christopher T,Great Missenden,4,What a bakers should be like,"A great variety of fresh and proper bread, the cottage rolls were superb, crusty on the outside but inside soft and fluffy.
A great selection of cakes, and of course we had to try the scones, although it was difficult resisting the temptation to buy 1 of everything!  The scones were perfect- not too big, light and tasty in their own right.  
And then the scotch eggs- yes real scotch eggs not those pale supermarket immitations.  Just enough crumb, a proper meaty sausage meat and then an egg that when it was cut open had a vivid gold yolk.  Oh and of course the pasty- one of the best I tried on this week in Cornwall.  Prcies fair, service with a smile and helpful advice 
Why isn't there a branch in my town?! ",27/06/2019

Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,A L,Sutton,2,Very poor quality bread. Really disappointed as we used this before (3 years ago).,Three years ago we used this bakery and loved it. But it has changed. I purchased a loaf of bread and as I cut it is started to crumble? The flavour was bland. Now we have used this bakery before and it was great. But it was not just me but my wife also who felt it was no where near the quality as before. In fact the local Morrisons Bakery was far superior. Dark topped fresh bread that tasted great. Way better and for a bakery to lose out to a superstore is so rare in my opinion. As for the pasties? Go across the road where you can see them being made at Pengenna Pasties. They are way way better. I know as I have eaten from both. Do the taste test if you want. But it will be obvious who is the winner.... enjoy :-),19/04/2019

Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,Stay3,,1,"£8.50 for 2 small, cold cheese and onion pasties!","A work colleague ran a lunch run for us and came back with two cheese and onion pasties, they were cold and not very big either. It cost me £8.50 for two pasties, appalling! My colleague even went back into the shop to double check they hadn’t short changed them! They didn’t even taste nice! We won’t be going back.

Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,Lisa O,London,5,Best bakers in Bude,"OMG where to start this is the best bakers I have been to for Gluten free goodies, there was a great selection and they all looked so good.  I had the lemon muffins which were really tasty you would never know they were gluten free and a pasty. You do have to wait 30mins while they cook the pasty but they take your mobile nozand call you when it’s ready and it was dead on the time given.
They have fresh bread as well you are spoilt for choice.
My daughter eats wheat and had the fresh pizza slice and the chicken curry pasty for the 2nd year running it really is our go to place for lunch when we are in Bude.

They also have a cafe further up the road that has waitress service and the girls were really polite.",01/09/2018
Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,Emsylou82,Runcorn,2,Disappointed ,"I had high hopes after reading some of the reviews and having a wheat intolerance I was looking forward to a gluten free pasty. I popped in and was advised if I came back in half an hour I could have one. 

So I did. I was told that it would be another ten minutes. I bought a “normal” pasty and scones and some gluten free scones, cream and jam and proceeded to wait for another 20 minutes. Eventually the young girl who had been dealing with me from the start came down and pulled a colleague to one side. I heard the lady say well just tell her and give her a refund. The young girl then came over to explain that the gluten free pasty had never actually gone in and refunded me the £4 something it had cost. I said it was ok and left the shop as I felt bad for her. 

On reflection though I don’t understand why I was told they had checked and it would be another ten minutes of it wasn’t in the oven. I also would never have bothered buying all of the other stuff and we would have ate somewhere else. I don’t think the response was anything like good enough once the mistake was realised. I had wasted almost an hour and had bought food for my partner and child and had nothing to eat myself. I don’t even blame the young girl, she was really nice and clearly mortified. She had asked an older and presumably more experienced colleague, potentially the manager or owner, for help. They should have stepped up not sent the poor girl over to apologise and give me my £4 back. 

I even waited a few days before submitting this review just to make sure I wasn’t fuming because I was hungry, haha! To top it off I warmed the GF scones that evening to have with cream and jam and they weren’t nice. Pete and Georgia advised their food wasn’t up to much either although they could have been trying to make me feel better. 

I may well get some defensive reply but please bear in mind I work with customers myself and I know that mistakes happen but service really fell short here and things could have been dealt with better. ",24/08/2018
Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,4ofususually,Harlow,3,Plastic found in pasty,"Unfortunately the pasty was a let down for us.

My wife dragged me inside the little shop and immediately the baking aromas said 'buy me, eat me' almost like Alice in Wonderland.  Then I saw the range of cakes and the 2 kindly ladies looked on and smiled as they had seen this bemused, 'what do I choose' look before.  

Not surprisingly we went OTT and bought bread and cakes enough for several days.  It was worth it.

Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,Rachel,Surrey,3,Not very clean!,"I visited here to buy two pasties. We came on our last holiday and really enjoyed them. 
Was disappointed firstly when my boyfriend opened the fridge to buy a bottle of water and cleanliness of the fridge was appalling! It was dirty and sticky all up the door and at the bottom of the fridge. You couldn't miss the dirt! Looking around I noticed some obvious cleanliness problems such as the walls were dirty and streaky and the floor. As a chef I'm aware of cleanliness of kitchens and I wasn't impressed at all by their shop or kitchen. 

The pasties are nice, but as soon as I noticed the poor cleanliness I didn't enjoy my pasty as much. A shame because we usually visit this shop when we're in Bude! The Assistant serving us was very knowledgeable regarding the pasties.

Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,Barnum81,Exeter,2,Very mediocre,"I live near Launceston and have given this place a go twice now while visiting Bude and have been disappointed each time.  A rather surly lady serving.

The pasty I had was dry, poorly filled and a bit gristly... definitely not a good representation of a Cornish pasty.

My partner bought donuts and mine was mediocre (not awful), but hers had some strange slightly green matter in it and went in the bin.  We weren't going to drive to Bude to take it back.

It's a shame because it's an old bakery but of course history doesn't necessarily count for a lot.

Lots of people seem happy with it looking at the reviews, and there's not a right lot of competition in Bude, but we've found better so won't be back.",08/07/2017

The Bude Sea Pool is free and cleaned every day by the tide and there are not many sea pools like this one in the country. It is maintained and paid for by local people. There are loads of restaurants to suit all tastes and pockets. Large car parks and wonderful walks along the coast or the canal. The beaches are sandy and the surfing is free. If you just want to sit and look at the sea, you could hire a beach hut and just relax.

When they handed it to me it was GIANT. I'm quiet a big bloke and have eaten my fare share of pasties and this was one of the biggest I've had. It was also packed with filling and wasn't bumped up with pastry. They also had different cakes and rolls but I had no room for them as I had to share my pasty with my dog, and she really liked it.",11/08/2016

The young lad serving allowed me to wait inside the shop until the rain had stopped, he also offered me a cup of tea while I waited. Which was a very kind offer, I was touched by the thoughtfulness. This kind of service is not seen very often these days, so thank you, kind sir.  The bread, scones and pasties we had had earlier in the week were delicious.

Lansdowne Bakery,4.5,Sarah Jane D,Hereford,5,Lush Danish & Awesome Bread,"It's always a treat when you can find a reliable bakery - especially when on holiday. When in South Hams we always detour to Frogmore to the bakery there with legendary doughnuts!
At the Lansdowne if you want sweet perversion try either a Forest Fruits or Apricot Danish. They are absolute whoppers compared to supermarket offerings & despite the syrup which will run down your arm (you can't avoid it like chewing a pastille) they are not sickly sweet. Just deliciously desirable.
The offer of a freshly baked pain au chocolate got my one adult son out of bed each morning to walk the dog on Summerleaze beach.
None sweet offerings - equally good are the range of breads and traditional Cornish Pasties. 
Do ask for a box if your purchases look delicate (we kept returning with ours to be refilled).",19/07/2016

I've also had a fair few genuine, traditional Cornish pasties, but the steak pasties I had here today was a clear winner.

The crispy pastry was cooked to perfection, with no soggy bottom. There were big lumps of dark, tender steak that actually tasted of beef.

The pasties suffer from poor ingredients, which probably makes them more authentic (the pasties the tin miners ate originally were unlikely to have contained prime beef), but not as good as others you can get in St Mawes.

Having said this pastry on the pasty itself is good and the seasoning inside is equally fine but the filling was really poor with virtually nothing other than potato in the vegetable pasty which was the flattest and most poorly filled that I have ever had the misfortune of buying anywhere.  

Come on guys, you can do far better than this and please can we also have the option of chicken.  Hopefully next time will be better, and please think about not directly handling products without tongs if you're also handling cash.

The Pasties here are lovely but our preference is chicken or veg.  St Mawes bakery only does traditional or cheese & veg as we don’t eat beef & we have have been here on numerous occasions when the veg have sold out.

Yesterday was no exception so we sat inside & settled for a coffee just as a fresh tray of traditional Pasties arrived to top up the unsold traditionals already in stock. During a period of around 10-15 minutes several customers came in for Pasties & their first question was what flavours do you do & the repeat answer being that we’ve only got traditional left.  We witnessed 11 customers with their families totalling around 20 + people walking back out empty handed because the bakery couldn’t supply for the demand with only a couple of others buying traditional.

I returned thinking my first impression must have been wrong given the number of stellar reviews on here but my second visit was worse than the first.

St Mawes Bakery,4.5,kellyo,St Stephen,4,Nice bakery but blue air......,"So its a Thursday lunchtime in sunny St Mawes, let's all have a pasty! 
As we live in Cornwall we have discovered lots of lovely baker's and this is a firm favourite when in the area, the pasty's are often seen being brought into the shop on huge racks and then devoured by the waiting queue and are delicious. The cakes are splendid too.
On this day however whilst waiting for our food in the shop, the lady behind the counter was discussing her car which she named and another guys driving skills very loudly with another customer which is fine I like a chat myself,  but her language was extremely choice indeed, the customer who was talking to her had a child and so did we, I had to hold my hands over my 7 year old sons ears! Not at all what I expected in a quaint little bakery in St Mawes. There is also another lady working there who is so very sharp and abrupt she's quite rude, I know your busy guys and these things probably won't stop people buying from you but it's not on really and very unexpected in such a lovely place. Your food is lovely and I would have reviewed you as excellent but for the blue air",03/06/2016

Crisp flaky pastry. Simple yet perfect balanced filling. It just does not get better than this. Apart from The Saffron Bun. A Cornish and Scandinavian delicacy, similar to a tea cake yet very different. The Saffron adds a pinch of luxury and these are genuine and absolutely use no food colouring. You can see flecks of delicate stems in the enriched dough. Recommendation – buy your pasty and eat it on the harbour wall. Then buy your bun and repeat. Lovely.",10/03/2016

The quality of what is served can be testified every morning particularly in the Summer months, by the queue out through the door. Fresh pasties are baked throughout the day and are often pre-ordered. The Bakery has an old fashioned charm, totally family run.

Sure enough 10 minutes later she arrived back with 12 fresh home made pasties. Word got out that a new supply was available. We had 1 each and the other 10 sold within 5 minutes - they were tasty, well filled and piping hot. Great cup of coffee and a pot of tea all for less than £9!

A Pasty and piece of Cornish Fruit Cake later and we both wanted more! Great value and delicious. If I was being ultra-critical, the pasty could have had some swede & a bit more seasoning but can't knock the meat content. Absolutely lovely thanks.",20/09/2015

So when my partner suggested that I have one I was ready to be under whelmed. What a surprise. The pastry was flakey and moist as well as tasty. I could have eaten the pasty without the filling. Then the filling had proper tasty meat and potatoes and vegetables that were really enjoyable. 
Sitting outside looking at the harbour made the experience even better. I'm a convert. The only problem is that the next pasty from another bakery may not be up to the incredible standard.",19/09/2015

I've never tasted a pasty so good in all my life - the crust was so buttery and tasty, while there was plenty of meat in the filling. So so flavoursome! The family who run the bakery are very proud of their pasties and rightly so. The recipe is a family secret and has been in the family for over a hundred years. I also had tea and a scone after my pasty, and again, this was so tasty. The scone was flawless and the Rooda's clotted cream that came with it was probably the best cream I've ever had. Such excellent value too. I'd definitely return to St. Mawes for this bakery alone.",05/09/2015

For the full immersive Cornish experience, I recommend sitting on the quayside and watching the boats and kids crabbing whilst eating. 

I expect we visited on a bad day, so will return again on this trip for another tasting - just to check on quality :-)",29/07/2013
St Mawes Bakery,4.5,Diane l,Roslyn Heights,5,"Yum,Yum, Yummy !!! Pastie to Die for !!!!!","My partner and I stopped by the sea wall in St. Mawes and had planned to take a wander through the town but we were also hungry....we just happened to find an area where people were sitting outside in the warm sunlight....then we noticed a little shop that had baked goods in the window....we ordered some tea for two and some pasties.....we took the pasties and tea and sat down to watch the seagulls flying overhead....my partner had the traditional pastie with beef,  and I had a vegatable pastie.....our first bites convinced us that we had stumbled onto the best pasties we had ever had eaten or that might ever exist in the entire world of ""pastie"" making.  As an American I had never been all that fond of pasties, but now I am a convert.  I would drive or fly to get to the St. Mawes Bakery just to enjoy the pure delight of eating one of their homemade pasties.",16/07/2013

St Mawes Bakery,4.5,Vivien U,Huddersfield,4,Childhood smells revived at Quay-side Bakery,"My 3penny treat some school days in the 1940s was a Walls Ice Cream in a paper wrapper from this everlasting local shop which now sells the best pasties ever! Dangle your feet over the water's edge while sitting on the Quay side opposite to enjoy your take-away and read my Walkabout St Mawes from amazon.com/author/vivienuff.  It leads you round the historic village sights in a short or extended figure of 8 and recalls my childhood delights.  Let yourself imagine the fun of past swimming galas, rowing races, the greasy pole and diving for plates just where you are sitting watched by countless boats of all descriptions tied up to a rope ending by the Idle Rocks hotel opposite.  Imagine the excitement of the schoolchildren dressed in white for the evening carnival and Floral Dance led by a silver band, dancing in and out of the Rising Sun, the St Mawes Hotel, the Watch House etc.  This bakery has seen it all and never lost its appeal for residents and visitors whether budget-conscious day-trippers or super-rich summer 'locals'.  The sea wall on either side is the perfect vantage point for the regatta on August 3rd where sailing boats come almost close enough to touch the Quay on a high tide - great for photographs of the crews.",13/06/2013

St Mawes Bakery,4.5,UpfromCornwall,St Austell,5,Worth the trip,"My wife and I were based in Newquay during our visit from Florida at the beginning of the year (Jan to April).

We spent many days 'Exploring Cornwall' and tried lots of different Cornish Pasties from a variety of locations during our explorations.

Without doubt, St Mawes Bakery Pasties became our absolute favourites. The pastry and filling were top quality and meeting Patrick, the baker/delivery guy, was an additional bonus  -  he's a charming chap.

Having decided that St. Mawes Bakery Pasties were our favourites, we would literally drive from Newquay to St. Mawes for a Pasty Lunch and took our pasties up to the Car Park by the Castle to enjoy with the view.

I would also urge potential customers to try those fabulous chunky Sausage Rolls that St. Mawes Bakery excel at  -  best Sausage Roll I have ever had.

As for prices, they might not be the cheapest but certainly represent the best value. 'Quality and Value' are better than 'Cheap' any day of the week.

Well Done Patrick and St. Mawes Bakery, keep up your standards and we look forward to seeing you next time we are in England.",21/04/2013

Fantastic job. The Cornish pasties are really excellent and the bacon rolls. You can choose how many pieces of bacon you want. So if you want a top bakery look no further for a great range of products.

Burbidge's Bakery,4.5,RodneyCucumber,Salisbury,2,Disappointed. Pea Pasty was burnt!!!!,"Not great if I’m honest!!! Arrived with great expectations but was very disappointed!!!! Maybe there should be variation in price depending on what time of day you arrive. We arrived at 12:45 and appeared to be left with the burnt flacks scraps!!!
Sausage roll was mainly left in tiny particles all over the car as it just disintegrated into dust as was so over cooked!
The pea Pasty wasn’t much better either. I say pea as 90% of the pasty was Pea!!  There was no moisture inside and the mince was dry as a donkey!!! 
Really disappointed!!!
Not all bad though!! The shortbread and carrot cake were bang on! Likely because they hadn’t been cooked for an eternity!!!!
Very expensive as well especially for over cooked burnt food, if we were in  restaurants it would have gone back!!!!
Staff were great as well",21/05/2022

I duly called in at 06:00 (yes, really, the phone was answered almost immediately!) and found out that Mrs. Burbidge had gone above and beyond and ordered a honey and spelt loaf for me to collect on Friday. I arrived at the store at 07:00. Wow! Was it ever obvious how popular this bakery is as I joined the socially-distanced queue outside. Going inside the store is an experience - even down to the TV on the wall showing the bakers at work! The staff were pleasant and efficient. But wait, that's not the best of it! The honey & spelt loaf is awesome, the texture and taste were second to none and I am looking forward to my next one already.

I eventually settled on a cinnamon bun and it was to die for. Totally amazing. Only downside was that I sat in the car to eat it and ended up with crumbs everywhere.",18/06/2018

Burbidge's Bakery,4.5,TeeBam4th,Havant,5,Still exception value for money,"I was a regular at Burbidge's, at lunch time, whilst employed at the DLO Andover, (2001- 2007) to partake of their enormous sausage in a Torpedo Roll. The lunch time walk justified this regular indulgence. I came in for a lot of stick too from my colleagues, because of these regular sorties. 

I had reason to pass Andover today, en-route to Tidworth, and HAD to make a slight detour, on the return just to sample the delights of Burbidge's once more!

I was not disappointed to be able to indulge, once more, in one of their enormous sausages in a roll. This delight is extremely good value for money, from what i would consider to be the Best Bakers in Hampshire""",26/04/2018
Burbidge's Bakery,4.5,Mike B,,5,Amazing Traditional Bakery,"Burbidge's Bakery is an absolute gem; a 100% genuine-baked-on-the-premises bakery which has been trading for five generations and offers a delicious range of breads, pastries, cakes and warm snacks.  The shop itself sits in a small parade on a through-road in Andover and, apart from its rather smart outward appearance, nothing  gives away the treasures that await inside.
When I dropped in for the first time yesterday to pick up a snack to eat in the car it was as if I'd been transported to the type of heaven dreamt of by small children ... trays of hand-made cakes, loaves of all descriptions, and the aroma of warm savouries.  All clearly made by people with a passion for the art of culinary seduction, and two lovely helpful staff.  Not only is the shop spotlessly clean and well-arranged, it also boasts a wall-mounted TV; not to watch football or the news, but the bakers in action in the bakery at the rear of the premises.
Being someone for whom the question in such circumstances is not what I should I buy, but rather what should I not, I found myself the proud owner of two of the most impressive lemon drizzle cakes  (one for afternoon tea, one for tomorrow), a pasty which simply oozed quality and an utterly genuine Eccles cake with none of the commercial sugar crust but instead heaps of beautifully spiced fruit in a lovely light puff pastry case.  But before I could complete my purchase a monster Belgian bun simply pleaded to be added to the order.
The fare tasted as good as it looked - my only comment, and this is a tiny one, is that for me the bun tasted even more delicious without the lemon icing, but then I'm not so much of a sweet-tooth these days.
It's a funny old thing, but while so many UK small towns can boast one of more genuine butcher’s shops, trying to find an equivalently authentic baker is becoming quite a task, particularly since the arrival of the well-known chains.  Burbidge's is a gem ... small and highly polished.  But if you want to sample its delights you'll just have to make the pilgrimage to Andover!",24/04/2018
Burbidge's Bakery,4.5,Dobbin145,Andover,5,The best bakery in Hampshire,"There's so much to say about Burbage's and it all good. From the simple loaves of bread to the bacon rolls and giant cheese straws it all just excellent. That's before you get to the cakes. OMG the cakes are just to die for. There's nothing fancy about any of the products they sell because the food us is on quality and value for money. If I could I'd eat nothing but cakes and sausage and bacon turnovers, but sadly I'd double in size within a week. ",04/03/2018

Clean, busy, bursting with good things to eat - sweet and savoury and of course loaves of bread - with cheerful and knowledgeable staff.

Time. After time. After time.

Or like today, get home to find that the order in the bag is completely different to the order that was given because the staff can't tell the difference between their own products.

The sign in the window pretty much reflects the level of mental activity in rhe place.
""We use eggs laid by real hens.""
Because everyone else uses eggs laid by cyborg hens, presumably?

I suspect they mean they don't use eggs laid by battery hens, but mentally overheated trying to produce a sentence that long and so instead produced a sign that sounds like it's on display at a shop in a space station in a sci-fi novel.

I love this bakery, everything is fresh and delicious. Their 7 seeded loaf is gorgeous and don't even get me started on the chocolate Danishes! 
They are always busy, the girls are always smiling and I personally think this reviewer was wrong. I have never worried or even noticed these ""hygiene"" issues.
Keep doing what you do Burbidges because your customers love you :)",25/09/2016

Burbidge's Bakery,4.5,Ray V,,1,"Delicious looking selections, but not hygenic","A few years ago I heard of this place and went to purchase some goodies. While waiting in line, I could see that the manager behind the counter was serving customers and taking money. However without washing her hands or wearing those plastic gloves she would just reach for the bread products with the same hands use to take the money. 

It did not seem to bother anyone else but it does me so I watch as other members of staff did the same thing. It has been a while (couple of years) but I went in there recently hoping to see improvements and was pleasantly surprised the staff was wearing those plastic gloves. So I stood in line but notice as I got closer to the front that some of the staff were taking money in the glove and then picking up the food with the same glove. 

How difficult can it be for goodness sake, the whole point of wearing those gloves is to keep dirty money away from the food. Using the same hand for the money and food negates the need to wear gloves. Why hand people back their change when you can just drop it in with the bread, certainly not much different than what you are doing now. 

A word to the management, it looks like you make nice baked goods and also sell some of those goods to local stores as there is one near me. If you have a high hygiene standard, not one will be offended but the other way around and you will lose customers no matter how good your products are. ",20/09/2016

Many people go to Burbidge’s for cooked breakfast – there is a good range of filled rolls and such like and there is a choice of sandwiches, cooked pies and other yummy things for lunch.
The cut bread is good, although I prefer it uncut. There are all sorts of rolls, personally the cottage rolls are my number one and the French loaves are also good

Their granary is the best and my children will eat no other.  It's always an added bonus when they come home from school and I've bought them either a fresh cream and jam doughnut  or their famously renowned chocolate Danish pastries ,of course the list goes on whether it be savoury or sweet.  
What I love about this shop is their quality of food and high standards. 
They are a happy, professional  team who always welcome you with a smile.  They are led by the man himself Steve Burbidge who you will often find on the premises and working hard. I have often seen him go the extra mile for people to make their Burbidge experience a memorable one.
 Burbidges Bakery has been around for generations and continues to thrive.  Personally I wouldn't go anywhere else, so I highly recommend you pop in and experience it for yourself.

Burbidge's Bakery,4.5,gauge_boson,Chippenham,5,Top of their game,"We live near Chippenham but luckily I have to make frequent trips past this famous purveyor of fine cakes. 

My other half's parents put us onto this gem years ago and it is far too temping to pass by. I know one should place quality before quantity but what happens when you have both? The size of some of the buns is ridiculous, but in a really nice way! My youngest son thinks he has gone to heaven when he sees the size of the doughnut I bring him home. 

Ok, so to the serious stuff: I think it is really unfair when supermarkets put sweets at the checkouts and the kids go 'I want, I want', but when a bakery puts 'taster trays' on top of their counter and a man over 40 enters... how cruel is that: of course I have to sample it all... it is the law!

So I end up buying the shop and taking it all back to Chippenham for the family to enjoy... again and again and again!

Burbidge's Bakery,4.5,Montypaws,,5,Probably the best bakery in the world,"I've been frequenting Burbidge's Bakery for the past 13 years and have never had anything but fabulous food and great service.  All of the ladies working in Burbidge's are cheerful even at 6.30 in the morning when the shop opens!
All of the products are made without preservatives etc, are a very generous size and are baked daily - you can even watch the bakery via a large tv in the shop.
Many people come for The jammy doughnuts - not your supermarket heavy stodge - these are light and airy and do not leave that awful trans-fat after taste that you get with some popular doughnut chains.  Also worth trying are the chocolate Danishes as experienced on a The Great British Bakery - they are so chocolaty with the perfect texture.
If travelling along the A303 towards the West Country, please do a slight 2 min detour for not only the cakes but a bacon sandwich - copious amounts of bacon in fresh subs or baps and a cup of tea for a price much much cheaper than a service station and also much tastier.  They're also the best hangover cure in the world.

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Roberto Medici,Burnham-On-Sea,5,Totally Awesome Product!,"We were on a City break as it was my birthday, and friend lives'  and work's there.
I had a too do list, which I ticked off, with dog-friendly Monty's for breakfast on last day, as well as Jacka Bakery for their bread & cakes!
Breakfast was good, so on too Jacka for my bread & cakes.
We got there before 9.00pm to get a prime spot, and were in top 4, awaiting my turn to get the tong's out!
I grabbed several paper bags, and filled with two loaves, and many cakes.
The bill was nearly £23.00, and you knew that they were top-end product, too.
The croissants were so flaky, as well as big, and I had the two first slices of Bakewell
Tart which were so damn good, I could have ate the whole tray!!!
Even our French Bulldog love's rich butter bakery products!
He knocked back a load with us in Waitrose car park, too!
I wish it was our local bakery, but it will have to wait until I visit my friend in the future, although I will have to check out Bristol's great bakery near Temple Mead Station which has a big following, due to it's amazing product like Jacka!",02/09/2021

Called in here today at 13.00pm and there was barely anything left, considering it was lunchtime. Paid £9 for 2 small quiches which were nothing special and were pretty much tasteless. Considering today has the jazz and blues festival on the Barbican and the pride festival on the hoe that they would have baked more food so there was more choice. Disappointed.",07/08/2021

They only have three little tables and the place is always packed. The drinks were good too. Only downsides are that it’s so popular there are always people coming in and out so you can’t really relax, and they don’t have a toilet for customer use, which as a pregnant lady was quite inconvenient.

I recommend the wild mushrooms on toast which is served with a golden-yolked organic egg from a local farm. 

If you like a sweet treat, Owen and the team bake a variety of pastries, cakes, buns and tray bakes every day. Every day brings variety.

Today I tried their doughnut fir the first time and I was astounded at how light, fluffy and springy it was, not greasy, not caked in sugar. The raspberry jam inside comes from another small business and it is available to buy at the bakery.

i used to go in once a week and I was lucky if I got an eccles cake every 6 visits
I have stopped going now as it seems that the staff are very smug to tell me that they don't have them and I started to feel a little uncomfortable actually asking.
I once bought all of the eccles that were on display and I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong..! I even ordered 2 to collect the next day and paid in advance only to be told the next day that they had sold them and they refunded my deposit

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,KateToon,Kingsbridge,3,Not usual standard,"We are regular visitors at the weekend & frequently bring visiting family & friends. However, we were let down on our recent visit as having ordered our breakfasts we waited & waited & had to ask where it was - only to be told they had no record of it. A muttered apology and a refund was given (which you would expect) & that was it! Disappointing as we usually love the bread & bakery products & have often recommended it. Yes mistakes occur but better customer service would have helped improve the situation (having to go to an appointment on an empty stomach!) & I now have second thoughts about returning",14/11/2018
Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Pemddle,Reading,3,Disappointing visit,"Arrived for opening and ordered 3 hot drinks, 2 breakfast dishes and also bought a loaf of sourdough. We got served our hot drinks at a usual speed and over half an hour later we still hadn’t got our cooked breakfasts. We had noticed other people who had come in a fair bit after us had already got theirs so we asked the waiters serving, whom of both remember us being one of the first customers in the bakery. Despite this and taking payment, they said unfortunately they could not see the order on the system anywhere. As we had important plans after this, we could not wait longer for the food to be cooked so unfortunately had to get a refund and go on an empty stomach. We were disappointed at the service, especially having been regular customers and how we we were not even offered a pastry to take with us for the inconvenience!",07/11/2018

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Tim G,Devizes,5,Truly Excellent,"We arrived mid afternoon in Plymouth and were looking for a light lunch.  We spotted Jacka's and popped in to see what was to be had.  The kitchen was just shutting down but they cheerfully heated up a pizza for us to share and made a couple of coffees.  The pizza was absolutely delicious, both the cheese and tomato topping and the lovely texture of the base.  The coffees came with some very professional latte art and were also very flavoursome.  It was easy to see why this place attracts rave reviews, and why their (in-house) baked goods go so fast.  Service was friendly and efficient and the prices were good.  What more can you ask?",20/07/2018
Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Roger G,Calstock,5,Wonderful,"Whether you just want to buy some bread or to sit down for something to eat, I cannot recommend Jacka Bakery highly enough. The bread, all sourdough, is excellent (although it would be nice to also have smaller loaves available) and the cafe make excellent use of it with first class snacks. I had toasted rye sourdough with wild mushrooms cooked in tarragon and topped with a lovely poached egg and green leaves. Looked and tasted lovely. Good coffee too.

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,ka2England,,5,Amazing Sour Dough,"I have tried sour dough from Glasgow to Plymouth (now) and Jacka's sour dough is THE best I have tried.  I previously thought one in South Shropshire was the best, but Jacks's beats that.  Price wise you get a large loaf for your money, so I don't get the comment saying it is expensive, quality foods needs quality ingredients and Jacka's uses these.  The crust is dark, crisp and delicious.  The crumb has holes and the right amount of sourness.  Such a shame I live 275 miles away.....",13/05/2018

The cowboy beans were absolutely delicious the best beans I have ever eaten - anywhere. Make an effort to try them ask for a small side order you will not be disappointed. Really friendly delightful staff who were happy to chat about their story of the bakery but would not divulge the cowboy beans recipe despite my best efforts.

Generous portions for a very reasonable price (even I struggled to eat it all) the entire meal was fantastic, fresh and looked beautiful, I spent a lot of the time there looking at other people's food to see what I would get next time. I'd previously tried their cinnamon rolls which was definitely worth the £2.40 price. The only downside is that this place is very small, but it's a testament to their quality how they are always packed! Very happy that this historic and independent bakery is such a success - you'll understand why when you visit! ",22/04/2018

Great there was table free.  We read the board on the wall which was menu and both chose bacon and eggs on toast.  When they arrived it was so so much more!

I am Italian and when I first moved in Plymouth I was so sadly disappointed by the quality of bread. Then I went to visit a friend and found this great peace of bread, that tasted like real bread! Since that point I have been regularly visiting Jacka Bakery. 
The bread is really really good, it's proper bread and not that crap that sell in all the other places. 
You also have a good choice of cakes, brioches and sandwiches. 
I have had pizza there once and it was good. I would suggest the people that make pizza to do it a little bit higher. It's too thin. Trust an Italian :)
I like that the place is really small, I find it lovely, really warm.
I suggest this place to everyone.",21/09/2017

On our second visit we ordered their handmade sourdough thin crust pizzas. The pizzas were quite large, but our 'food snob' 3-year-old daughter loved it so much that she finished her Margherita in just minutes! And she's proudly earned a jacka bakery's sticker from the friendly lady behind the counter. 

Also, they make the most amazing Eccles cakes. Highly recommended! ",13/09/2017
Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Philip H,Larne,2,What a shame!,"Firstly let me say the place is quaint and feels great and obviously the bread is impressive.
The food we had was very tasty but perhaps a little expensive. That said it wouldn't have stopped us from returning.
Service was mixed - first guy was happy and friendly, but got our order wrong. The second guy wasn't so happy and friendly but he was in charge! Service was quick and the food was hot.
The problem really was when a slightly overweight Labrador was admitted into this small establishment! The owners tried to keep it quiet but it growled  at other costumers and left my wife and I feeling uncomfortable.
The staff assured the owners that the dog was very welcome! Perhaps more welcome than their paying costumers!",12/09/2017
Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Justine K,Plymouth,5,Yummy breakfast,"I'd been trying to go here with my partner since the beginning of my pregnancy, as bread has been quite high up on the cravings list! Sadly, the only day off my partner and I had shared for quite some time had been a Tuesday, the day that they are closed!! The fates changed and we have now got two days off a week with each other and have finally managed to make the well-worth trip to Jacka bakery this morning and we were not disappointed. I even woke my partner up early and got ready and dressed in record time to be there right on the dot for opening so that we could sit in and have breakfast, much to his surprise. I had the wild mushrooms and tarragon on toast with a fried egg and he had the croque monsieur, both of which were absolutely delicious on their freshly baked sourdough bread, all I can say though is WOW the portion sizes are insane, which normally I would LOVE but growing a baby means fitting in as many delicious mushrooms as I got was a challenge proved too difficult at this point. I will definitely be back again either to share a breakfast with my partner or after our baby is born so I can devour the whole lot in one sitting with no difficulty. Absolutely delicious food and coffee too (my mocha was the loveliest mocha I've had in a while, nice and chocolately!). If I'd been on my own I probably would've bought the shop out of one of everything on display as it all looked incredible and was selling like crazy but my partner is the sensible one and purchased a sourdough stick instead for us to have for our work lunch tomorrow, which I'm eagerly awaiting too, can't wait to go back again! Thanks for such a lovely breakfast with such delicious bread (and mushrooms).",10/09/2017

Having bought just about every type of baked delight from the display I can honestly say this is a magnificent bakery with some very talented bakers. The pain au raisin was soft full of raisins he topic was crisp and the laminated layers were stunning. The croissants were fluffy, buttery and crisp. The Eccles cake was full of raisins with a beautifully light crisp outer. Pain au chocolat, simply divine.  The best however I saved til last Jacka's sourdough loaf was the most comforting bread I have had. Fluffy centre with a crust to die for. If you are ever within 50 miles of this shop it's well worth a visit 😁. To wash this all down they also sell a wonderfully rich nutty coffee. ",29/07/2017

Most Sundays I now pop onto the Barbican with my little Border for a walk and into Jackas for a loaf and two Bakewell tarts for Sunday pud. All I can say is you got to try them to believe how delicious they are, never tasted any others that come close to these.

I love the fact when you get there and they've been busy the bread you want might be gone, so its lovely just to go in and pick up another kind, if you don't mind that you'll not be disappointed as its all fab.

So much more to try yet, can't wait!",25/07/2017

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Fiona G,Plymouth,4,Holiday breakfast treat,"We decided to try out the number one breakfast location in Plymouth. The bakery was small but welcoming. We ordered the traditional bacon and egg on toast and vegetarian version which was pesto, sun dried tomato and feta cream. The portions were large, the bread was beautiful,the coffee and orange juice were the favourites. I enjoyed my breakfast but on a personal note the feta cream wasnt to my taste so i would return but not have that again. I did finish the whole plate though! In conclusion a great place to visit in a fantastic location.",05/07/2017

I chose the wild mushrooms with tarragon on sourdough toast, my wife had bacon and egg on toast. Both were lovely, and very good value, Our only criticism was that they were so big that we struggled to finish them. The coffee was top quality too.

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Franzie33,York,5,A must visit for any food lover.,"Well, where to start. I have visited here several times with both take out and eating in. The bread alone is OUTSTANDING and worthy of all the accolades and awards given. The quality and standard that is constantly achieved is a true testament to the time, dedication and one can only assume love that is put in to each and every item baked. I like the simplicity of the menu only to discover a huge range of depth and flavour with each mouthful that always leaves me hankering for more. The pastries are delicious and the coffee outstanding. Just when you think it could get no better, the staff are excellent, knowledgeable and incredibly customer focused without intrusion. I am not sure how you all do it but keep up the good work. Finally, I have deliberately avoided saying what is my favourite items are or have been as this establishment lets you find you and your tastebuds will always be bringing you back.

This is small family run Bakery so be warned when they run out, they run out. For me that's one of the nice things about it. 

I witnessed today (Easter weekend) several people getting heated about the fact there was no bread left to buy!!  As I've said it's a small Bakery, if you want bread after midday go to Morrisons! 

This is a fantastic individual high quality Bakery so get in early.  If you miss out don't have a go at the staff!! ",14/04/2017

Wherever I go in the world I seek out local sourdough bread as it's my favourite and I try to see if there is anyone who can top Jacka, especially in the USA where they pride themselves on sourdough baking - I can tell you it's not as good as Jacka, not by a long shot. So pleased to have this quality produce on my doorstep (relatively, I'm in Torpoint).  I have tried their cakes and brownies too and they are rich and luxuriant, just like a cake or treat should be.

We wanted a pasty, it was late in the afternoon and they only had 'Christmas' pasties, i.e. Turkey and cranberry, so that is what we went for (despite it being November and Christmas not starting yet!!) and it was DELICIOUS! Followed up with a slice of Blackberry Bakewell Tart which was also amazing. All of which was good value. Highly recommended. ",22/11/2016

The Cinnamon Swirls are to die for and then there was; Chocolate Brownies, Sourdough Bread, White Chocolate and Raspberry Cake, Coffee and Walnut Cake, Eccles Cake, Cherry Blackwell Flapjack. Er, yes - I remember everything that was in the shop window and no, I just couldn't have everything but it all looked wonderful as I tucked into my Cinnamon Swirl. Oh - they do do breakfasts also but I was on strict instructions, light breakfast only (sigh)!!",13/11/2016

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,c_easton3,Hitchin,5,Delightful Cafe and Bakery,"We popped in here on Monday, tempted by the array of lovely breads and bakes in the window.  A cold, rainy day in Plymouth had sharpened our appetites, so this Cafe and Bakery was a welcome find.

My partner chose a Sourdough Baguette and an Almond Slice.  I settled for a huge Cinnamon Bun and a Fruity Flapjack.

The baguette was rustic and full of rich, sourdough flavour. The Almond Slice was rich and buttery with just the right combination of almond frangipane and crisp pastry.

My Cinnamon Bun was a giant swirly-whirly pillow of soft, silky layers and fragrant cinnamon sugar.  Absolutely delicious! 

The flapjack was also very generously sized.  It was sweet and syrupy without being cloying or sickly.  It was packed with fruit and coconut chips and had a perfect texture.  It had just the right amount of chew, without being a tooth-breaker!

A further bonus – the Flapjack kept really well in the cake tin for 2 days.  After the super-sized Cinnamon Bun, I couldn’t justify eating a Flapjack as well!

This is a quality establishment offering lovely breads and bakes of very generous size.  I look forward to visiting again to try coffee and lunch.",26/10/2016

A tiny shop with only 3/4 tables, but comfortable. We grabbed a loaf of sourdough to take home, it was ok but not up there with the best we've tasted. Service was a little abrasive, not the friendliest welcome but I can't fault his barista skills. Will definitely visit again for the coffee!",25/10/2016

Wonderful window display of breads and cakes, all to tempt you inside. I had mushrooms in tarragon on sourdough toast, with a fried egg on top and my partner had the small breakfast which was served with a cup of tea. I had a lovely latte. Staff very friendly. Just had to buy a sourdough loaf which I have to report was lovely and what little that was left after a couple of days was delicious toasted. Will return soon to try more bread.

Bought two loaves that lasted us ages whilst we were on our Cornish holiday !
Also bought giant eccles cakes and cinnamon buns (yum), which were disappearing fast from the shelves - considering we were there promptly for the 9am opening) ...not many left by 9.30 - the locals were coming in and buying them all!
Its a very popular bakery... however the breakfasts were a little bit greasy and we were shocked when the chef refused to cook poached eggs for our full english breakfast... and insisted we had to have fried!?
...even though there is a poached eggs on toast option on the menu?

The waiter apologised and thought the chef was having a wobbly!!
It was all a bit weird.
Everything was OK - just a bit too oily.....mostly fried items.

Anyway we enjoyed our time at the Bakery, as the atmosphere & surroundings were great. Staff were lovely and really accommodating (not the chef), our coffees great.
Breakfasts just a bit too greasy!",21/09/2016

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Abbi J,,5,The perfect evening at a private function,"One of my best friends organised an engagement party this weekend for me and my fiancé at Jacka Bakery. I didn't not know this was possible, but they booked out the venue for a fee and they staff allowed them to add decorations and small additions to make it look beautiful, then also stayed, and for £10 each, cooked us the most amazing pizzas. We had a choice of three and all went down a treat! The staff themselves were so welcoming, and made the event great, being on hand in general as well as serving the food, taking coffee orders, and ready to clean up at the end. They also allow the Bring Your Own Booze policy which makes it feel so much more personal, and we also brought our own cakes and brownies. It is small so a group of 15 was perfect, a few more would have worked but over 20 would be a squeeze. We honest had such a great time, we are already looking for an excuse to do this all over again! Amazing!!!",18/09/2016

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,PeterPlymouth,,5,Been there for centuries,"I have lived in Plymouth for all of my fifty plus years and Jacka's bakery has been the same since my childhood. The original oven reputedly dates back centuries, but is now in disrepair. 

However, the current staff and owners are committed to doing something 'different', if not unique in producing traditional breads.

The pasties they produce are the best I have ever tasted, but consequently sell out quickly. So, if you want pasties then order in advance. 

There is seating inside and outside for tea and small meals, which are upmarket and popular.

The baker has also kindly agreed to look into the possibility of producing authentic biblical bread of the type used at the Last Supper. Apparently, the bread produced at present is of a type dating back to ancient Egypt!",24/08/2016

The tomatoes were incredibly sweet. My husband had the ploughmans which had all sorts of lovely treats. You do need to wait a while, but the wait is definitely worthwhile. We were totally stuffed after our lunch, their prices are very reasonable too. We did have to have a pain au chocolate to walk around with afterwards. Having tasted lots of pain au chocolate in France as well as home. I have to say Jacka's is one of the best that I have tasted.

Arrived about ten and shelves were already getting empty, only one croissant left and seven pain au chocolates.  Ordered one each and by the time we had sat at one of the three tables the rest had been snapped up. £2 per croissant but they were the size of two tesco ones and absolutely delicious.  Latte was one of the nicest I've had for a while and the guy serving very friendly.  In the short time we were there they sold all their remaining brown loaves  and only one white remaining.  They were cooking pasties for lunch which sounded nice too.  Great artisan sour dough bread which is very popular with locals and the visiting yachting folk.  If you want to try them get there early as I think they sell out quickly.  Closed on Tuesday.",17/08/2016

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Skihorn,Guildford,5,Perfect ,"All I ask is that I can find places to eat and shop which are operated and staffed by people who are passionate about what they do. They are here and it really shows. Thoughtfully made coffees - not churned out by some under-trained ""barista"" wearing a corporate tee shirt - served by friendly staff happy to chat about what they do, fantastic breads (although admittedly most had sold out by the time I arrived which is testament to how good they are!) and soothing folky sounds provided by John Martyn in their tiny, intimate shop front. 

This is the model for others to follow. Please everyone, stop wasting your money on less than mediocre products pedalled by giant corporates solely interested in prizing as much of your hard earned cash from you as possible. Let's put the focus back on quality, service and HONEST pricing, not on profit margin and satisfying greedy managers and shareholders. 

Apologies for this becoming a bit ranty! I know this is not the place - but it reinforces his good places like this are. Thank you Jacka Bakery for enhancing my day and bringing out the sunshine in my mind on this otherwise grey Plymouth Saturday. ",13/08/2016

It wasn't my first visit and certainly won't be my last. There was a mix up with my order which was rectified with excellent customer service and my three cheese on toast when it arrived was delicious and the salad was beautiful. I was treated to a piece of lemon polenta cake by way of an apology for the mix up and the wait for my order (unnecessary as I was happy to wait but a great gesture all the same) 
My husband visited whilst I was doing race for life this Sunday too and had coffee and a cinnamon bun. Also delicious apparently

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Sandyorkshire,Plymouth,5,Delightful bakery with small seating area,"Jacka Bakery has had a place in Plymouth's historic Barbican area for centuries serving cakes and pasties to take away.   A change of owners has revolutionised the 'shop' which now has seating for approximately 10 diners.   The bread is baked on the premises and is absolutely the nicest tasting bread I have ever enjoyed.  I have only had lunch, not being 'an early bird' to enjoy breakfast and the bread element features heavily on the menu together with pizzas.  The fillings for sandwiches and toasties are quite unusual ( toasted sourdough bread with 3 cheeses and fresh chilliest is my current favourite).   The cakes are huge .... needing taking away for later enjoyment.  Coffee is hot and the staff are friendly, polite and helpful.  My only reservation is that positive comments (very well deserved) will lead to more customers and may result in my not finding a seat!   Incidentally Jacka is closed Tuesday.",25/04/2016

Trip advisor had highly rated it as a must and as it was the oldest bakery in England we knew we would be in for a treat.The sign on the door said it was closed until Wednesday. So bright & early Wednesday morning we all arrived down to the Barbican and we really were not dissapointed. The smell when we walked in was heavenly and all the fresh crossiants, Eccles cakes, cinnamon buns, pain au chocolat and various sour dough breads were placed in the Window ready to choose from. The place never emptied with people calling in and as soon as things were took off the shelves more items were replaced.

We spotted Jacka Bakery when looking for somewhere to eat lunch.  We ordered the Welsh Rarebit, a veggie calzone and the tomatoes on toast.  It was all totally delicious. I had a cinnamon roll with coffee afterwards, and it was the best I have ever had.  I would have taken some away too, but they all sold out while we were there.  The staff were great, and the interior is really well done.  The ONLY very slight negative is that it isn't big enough, but there's nothing they can do to change this, so I've still given it a 5 star rating.  We were sat by the door which was a bit chilly as the weather was so bad, but it was well worth it. Great staff too.",02/04/2016

We had seen the reviews on Jackas, so decided to see if we could have lunch there. What a fantastic decision that was. The staff are so friendly, there was a warming feeling as soon as my coffee arrived (I was cold from the walk). I ordered a Calzone, meatballs and pepperoni (as good as one I had in Barcelona some years ago and haven't found one decent enough to compare to that experience until now), my partner a Croque Monseur. We were both a little concerned when they arrived, as the portion size seemed a little bit large. Both items were shared and somehow we managed to finish them together with the lovely salad that accompanies them, simply because they were delicious. We were so impressed, that more coffee was purchased and to take away for later on our trip, pasties (simply the best I have ever had), an Eccles cake that is utterly rich and melts in your mouth and lemon curd slices that are zingy and scrummy. Shame I live in Birmingham, because if I lived in Plymouth, I would have to own a pack of hounds to remove the extra calories I would consume as Jackas would easily become a weekly visit.

We had only put in £1.50 because we had no cash on us. So I ran back up to the car park and the machine would not accept cards. It had broken down. I rang up the authority and asked them to at least mend the machine for other users. Of course they don't care about whether you cant use the machine. If you are over the time , they will fine you. Anyway. I ran back down to the cafe, feeling stressed, hungry, my elderly mother on her own. The cafe gave me £1.50 to pay the machine. I offered a larger note so they were compensated and they refused. They chatted and were very kind to my mother. More to the point, the food was lovely and I will recommend this to all my friends and family.

Buy goodies to celebrate my recent birthday brunch and all I can say is they were very very Impressed by the beautiful range of sour dough breads on offer and the delicious and very large croissants and pain au chocolat amongst other desirable treats that they served up at the brunch.  They also said what an amazing cup of coffee they bought whilst they waited for their purchases.  Even the dog doesn't miss out they bake fresh every day including dog biscuits.  I would like to wish the new proprietors well with this venture and hope they are here for a very long time to come.,15/12/2015

Jacka's is a great new local business that is impressing and proving itself over and over again.

It is attracting regular trade but few of us live within convenient walking or working distance. We need to park, especially in the morning, to buy fresh bread, croissants etc. There is a parking bay just where it's needed right outside but as I discovered today to my swingeoning cost, the whole of Southside St is (and apparently has been for years) covered by a parking ban until 11am except for loading and unloading. No good for bakery customers! Be warned. And my traffic warden would not accept that stumbling in and out to buy armfuls of goodies was 'loading'.",09/10/2015

Myself and my friend ordered the Sourdough Pizza's, whilst his girlfriend and my girlfriend both had the grilled sandwiches. We werent kept waiting too long before our food came out, and every one of our meals looked absolutely fantastic. I had pepperoni and jalepenos on my pizza, and it was hands down the best pizza that Ive ever had the pleasure of putting into my mouth. I also had a Nicaraguan coffee, which was also very tasty.

I was more than impressed when dashing in with a colleague to be greeted by the fantastic aroma of coffee, breads of all descriptions and a new welcoming layout to sit and ponder over the choices.
 Unable to choose, I left it to Carly - whose cheerful manner and welcome made it comfortable and relaxing to just sit back, relax and enjoy the 30 mins lunchbreak we had! Coffe and a spicey chicken ""toasted""sourdough sandwich with a mix of salads, dressings etc was presented and thoroughly enjoyed.

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Joe S,London,5,Excellent progress from a standing start.,"I am very pleased at the early success of this business. For a long time we had felt it was a great pity the preceding owners had let it run down in a bland uninspiring way. The family who have taken it over have thrown their all into the venture, and have increased the staff, the range and the developed not only the retail trade but also started selling to local caterers. I come in regularly, it is always friendly and helpful and they remember faces. My only disappointment is when even late morning they have often sold out of what were probably big stocks of eg baguettes and other loaves. I suppose that that is par for the course even with large scale operations. I think it's a pity they don't have the cover to open on Tuesdays. I hope that they manage to further extend the shelving at the front to include more of the stock. I look forward to news of the viability survey and perhaps recommissioning of the old oven at the back. I think the next challenge here will be whether these delightful and historical premises can remain big enough for a business that seems destined to thrive and expand. Someone ought to talk to the council to see whether the parking bay outside could be limited to say 15m. Although we can walk over from QAB lots of customers must find it almost impossible to find a place to stop and come in to buy fresh daily bread etc. The Barbican needs to treasure first rate businesses in amongst the vast amount of tourist tat. The recent arrival of the freshly cooked fish counter on The Quay is up there with Jacka's. I hope the council and local traders representatives recognise this enlightenment and encourage it.

It is a bit odd that Jacka Bakery is hidden amongst the specialist listings just as a bakery. Although it is also a small cafe it probably ought to appear also on the restaurant and coffee shop lists.",19/08/2015

Jacka's really are going from strength to strength and were already good at the outset. If this is a part of new Plymouth then bring it on and plenty of it.

But the bacon rolls in fresh muffins are the best in Plymouth, the chocolate brownies are rich, gooey and baked to perfection. All I'm going to say about the pasties is you just have to try one - the other posts give details of them and recommend them as highly as I do. They do great coffee too. 
Every time we return they've improved something and it's great to see their wares now displayed in the window too. Definitely one to try, it will be even better once they get permission for seating, but right now you can grab a coffee and a pastry or bacon roll and eat it while taking in the sights and sounds of The Barbican.

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Malcolm B,,5,Hurray! Plymouth has woken up to real bread!,Cornwall has had artisan bakers for years now and I always wondered why the Barbican didn't have one.

I came in because there was talk of the opening and I was not disappointed.

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Chris D,,5,5* for effort but please get it together.,"Dearly want it to succeed but fear that they may be wavering. The bread is good as are the pastries. Yet to try the pasties. I fear the intent to turn it into a dinky slightly prissy cafe patisserie may distract from the USP which has to be the skilful reintroduction of artisan baking into the Barbican/city centre. Impressed by the first days' loaves we came back on Tuesday only to find the shop shut, a sad note scrawled on a piece of brown envelope stuck inside a window, 'Closed on Tuesdays'. Sounds permanent. What's that about then? Inside the customer area was full, almost to the ceiling with IKEA boxes. 

Please, please guys don't bungle an otherwise very promising start.",27/05/2015
Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Mac M,,5,Good to see (and taste) it.,"Always on the look out for good bread and bakery. Could never understand why Jakka's didn't take advantage of it's history and location. Now suddenly it's begun. Came in this weekend and delighted to see it.  Ot sure that they are pushing themselves hard enough to the public but the formula (which may need tweaking) is not bad. If they try to turn it into a dinky tea shop/patisserie then I doubt it will last but if they use the coffee croissants cake etc to coax peole in to buy bread then it may do well. Who knows they may manage it all? It would be great to come down to Plymouth and see a steady stream of people coming from the shop with armfulls of fine smelling warm bread. Get in there and try it. If you live in Devonport try the Column Bakehouse in the Kerr St guildhall basement. Bread can be so much better than the sliced or supermarket varieties.

Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Terry C,Plymouth,5,Completely new approach - bodes well.,"Came in today to check out the newly reopened Jakka's bakery on the Barbican. It's very different from at least the last twenty odd years. They are baking here again. Apparently led by a couple of guys who had been baking at the Royal William Bakery who felt that the city needed a very good artisan bakery shop. Jakka's has been boring and basic for a long time but there is always some demand for pasties and bog standard sandwiches/rolls. The fresh idea seems to be to have a daily choice of three or four breads, some croissants and pain au chocolat together with some cakes and a couple of in your face coffee machines. I saw a lot of other enticing stuff on a board but you can only try so much in one go. I took home a big white country loaf that was excellent (approx £3.50) and had a couple of the outsized pain au chocolat (£2.40). They also do full breakfasts for £6.50 and sourdough English muffins with smoked bacon for £3.50. It all looks quite interesting. They have put a counter a cross the long thin room and left space for some tables. Not sure whether there is space or they will be allowed to put some out on the pavement.  So far so good, I think it will do very well, especially if people get to hear about it.",23/05/2015
Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Joe S,London,5,Rejuvenation/resurrection after wasted years.,"I have been part of a small but growing informal unorganised group of enthusiasts who have for several years been pressing for what is claimed to be the country's oldest continuing commercial bakery, to be restored to full on artisan baking on site, preferably using the ancient oven built into the back wall. I can claim no credit. It has just been a communal yearning. But at last others, with skill and resources, are putting the dream into action. Within the next two weeks, roughly the spring bank holiday, the shop is reopening after restoration, as an artisan bakery (with speciality coffees !?) and although they will be using big electric ovens for the time being it seems thought is being given to whether the old oven can be effectively repaired and reccommissioned. I look forward to being amongst the first customers when we are back at QAB for the long weekend. I hope we soon see some new photographs on this thread and that the business can get a good website going or at least a Facebook page.",16/05/2015
Jacka Bakery & Delicatessen,5,Hilly J,Plymouth,5,"Whoopee, reverting to artisan baking under new owners.","Best news on the Barbican in years, Friary Mill industrial bland bakers have thrown in the towel and Jakka's has found delightful new owners working hard to reopen in time for the spring bank holiday as a specialist artisan bakery. Sadly they don't yet have the cash to repair the original wood fired oven at the rear because of expensive Robles with the brick lining but let's hope for the future. Slight pity that they haven't felt able to recreate the old Jakka signage and the new name letters look a bit twee and dinky but what matters is the quality of the bread and other goodies.

What a huge disappointment. They don’t seem to bear any similarities to those we’ve bought hot from the bakery in the town. 
Hardly any meat at all, one pasty had just two tiny pieces of tough meat. No swede or the usual pepper just layers of potato.

I'm not one for writing reviews. However, after waiting for roughly 16 minutes for something to be warmed up, I am not impressed.
I could easily see 2-3 members of staff standing around by the ovens chatting and on phones while Front of house staff jumped from one thing to another. The only reason I even received my food when I did, was thanks to a lady on the till enquiring as to why I was waiting.

Unfortunately I am now left with a burnt rock solid lunch and no time to eat it.
Needless to say I am unhappy with my experience today and will most likely refrain from coming back unless necessary.

Anyway I saved it to have for my tea. What a massive let down. There was very little meat. The only good thing was it wasn't too peppery. It was distinctively underwhelming, especially for the price.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Chris,Worcester,2,"Pale, undercooked and unseasoned","We walked into Padstow today and were starving. We had a traditional pasty and a chicken, bacon and cheese pasty.  I absolutely love Cornish pasties when I’m on holiday in Cornwall. The pasty I had today was the worst I have had. The pastry was pale and stodgy and the potato was undercooked. Both of those things could have been solved by longer cooking. But the real disappointment was the filling was completely unseasoned. None of lovely warm peppery flavour you expect.  My friends pasty was much the same, she found that hers was unseasoned. Such a pity when I have heard such good things and there’s so much competition. Was it just today’s cook? Not going to risk it again. Sorry.",08/09/2021

We bought two steak pasties from the Padstow shop last Sunday and I have to say they were appalling. The meat was tough, the filling slimy and no discernible flavour. We have had their pasties before but these were terrible. Both tasted cheesy too - apparently clotted cream is a special ingredient, but is your cream off?

Lamb and mint - zero meat basically minty potato 
Cornish - zero meat strong flavour of swede 
Chicken and Bacon - zero chicken was some bacon and really salty

The Chough Bakery,4.5,MaxLondon2,London,5,Sublime!,"In over 12 years of reviewing and over 200 reviews I’ve only ever given a five star marking to 3 or 4 places but Chough Bakery gets it!

We were in Pladstow during a week’s stay in Cornwall with the relaxing of the Covid lockdown and were feeling peckish and spotted Cloughs’ on the corner. 

Good Covid protocols were in place and we swiftly conducted our purchases before sitting on a bench opposite the shop and overlooking the harbour to eat.

I have to say this was the best Cornish pasty I have ever tasted!  Most pasties I’ve had have been thick crusty pastry with a small filling and plenty of space within the pasty.

Not this one!!

Thin tasty pastry wrapped around a fully stuffed pasty and I mean FULLY stuffed.  Steak, blue cheese, and onions filled the pasty, it was perfect and very reasonably priced,

Having been in Cornwall for 3 days and yet to have a pasty it seemed right that our first one should be from Chough. So we joined he queue and came away with a large traditional pasty.

Unfortunately what I bit into was just tasteless mush with hardly any meat, more like baby food in a pastry casing.

Definitely won't bother again will stick to Pengenna from now on",31/10/2020

The Chough Bakery,4.5,IanHudTravel,Lymington,5,Drove for miles to get my annual supply box !,"This is the second year we have taken a special trip here while down in Cornwall to Chough Bakery. We always grab a hot pasty to go (traditional always the best) and then a box of large to take home.

I am very picky about my pies and pasties so when I say these pasties are amazing and do not disappoint it is based on trying a lot of pasties in a lot of places and also those who the claim “best party in the world”.

The traditional pasty is loaded full, made of a proper pastry (not too much puff or too flaky) and not like those ones that begin with G that are soggy, more pastry than filling and not worth a pound ! It is spicy with pepper as it should be and there is a crunch to the veg inside and loads of steak.

Always friendly staff make it a pleasure to choose the box full to take home. They freeze great and are then a really treat to warm up on a winters days !

Well done Chough Bakery for another great pastry and cannot wait time crack open the box when we get home tomorrow and the rest to freeze for a treat later....",25/10/2020

Clearly ‘yesterday’s’ but nothing said, no offer of heating them up and full price charged.

The pasty was absolutely delicious, my friend had traditional but I have to say the chicken, bacon and cheese one (with leeks) was divine.

I was actually a bit dubious as to wether the pastry was vegan, I had a couple of bites and could see meat. I warned my husband who had a couple of bites and unknowingly he'd eaten meat for the first time in 32 years. We went back into the shop pretty angry and pretty devastated explained very politely to the young girl what had happened and asked to see the owner. I explained to her what had happened she just shook her head and said I'll swap them for you they got put on the wrong shelf! SHE ACTUALLY LOOKED A BIT PUT Out! No apology just looked at us with contempt and reluctantly gave us two vegan pasties which we put in the bin as had lost trust! It is understandable that at really busy times this mistake could have happened but we were the only people in there and was a quiet time. It was just clear that she didn't care one bit what had just happened and didn't realise the magnitude of what had just happened. I would strongly advise all vegans to steer clear of this woman and her business. ",10/08/2020

I am sad to say that the pasties we had today were very disappointing, bland and flavourless. I had a steak and blue cheese pasty which, to be honest, was void of any blue cheese at all and the steak was quite grisly. My wife had a traditional pasty and again she said it was unseasoned and flavourless. We both agree it used to be much, much better. Not just the pasties but the service, which my wife explained to be very lacklustre and unhappy. It was a huge shame as we had brought family with us expecting to be amazed.

Had a medium pasty, it was luke warm and I wondered what all the fuss was about, it was just average and can't figure out wht people like this place so much.

Very average pasties and not cheap at near to four and half pounds a pasty compare with supermarket ones that in my opinion taste the same at nearer to two pounds or even Gregg's.

If you must buy one, I'd ask for a hot one that's just come out of the oven but I wouldn't go out if my way to eat here.",26/10/2019

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Meggymoo83,Nottingham,1,Terrible service,"NEVER LEAVE REVIEWS but had such a terrible experience I have to share!!! Took my dad to Padstow for his birthday which also happened to be the last day of our holiday in Cornwall and he had been raving about the pasties at choughs all week. Ordered him a Cornish pasty and myself a veggie one which also happened to be vegan, which I though was great and very inclusive- you don’t get much of that where we are from! First bite of our pasty’s not only were they cold but the pastry was still raw inside! We took them back and politely explained, the sever who was a young girl with cropped short hair snatched it out his hand and rolled her eyes ‘it is cooked it’s just really thin pastry’... we looked at each other a bit puzzled and I admit tried not to laugh because nothing about the explanation she offered made any sense. With a huff she said ‘I can give you a new one but it will be exactly the same’. Tbh at this point we should have just asked for out money back and gone elsewhere but we were a bit taken a back by the whole situation. He got a new pasty and I sheepishly reminded her mine was the same. ‘Well that ones vegan so it’s definately fine’ she snapped and turned and served someone else before I could respond. Fortunately, the other lady kindly fetched me another and it was better. (Still cold and not very flavourful though). As someone who works in customer service I am very understanding and the situation could so easily have been put right but this girl had a terrible attitude! If you don’t like people go and I think you should go and work somewhere else! And if she was having a bad day I still think she needs to be taught a thing or two about how to approach customer complaints and how to rectify a situation... Don’t tell me I’m wrong to start with... I have got better things to do than queue up and pretend my pasty isn’t cooked! Do not recommend getting a pasty here!",14/09/2019

What we got was only ok. Slightly pale. Reasonable seasoning. Plenty of root vegetables. Very little meat. About three small pieces in each large steak pasty. 

In an era when we know more than ever that eating a balanced diet is important for public health, I think it not unreasonable to suggest a large pasty that costs 5 pence less than £5 should offer at least 50 grams of meat rather than about 20 grams ( half and ounce ) these had  ",28/08/2019

They microwave from frozen which put me off slightly but thought I’d give it a go. Oh dear. Really thick tasteless chewy pastry and extremely dry mediocre filling. Awful. The worst I’ve tried by far.

Fantastic value and the best gluten free scone I’ve ever tasted! It’s a shame I live 3hrs away otherwise this would become a regular treat.

We have tried a few around Cornwall over the years and some have come up better than these sad to say. We served by a guy who we deemed to be slightly rude, and a bit arrogant. He obviously hated small talk about Choughs itself and please of Thankyou did not come easy either. I though it best not to comment on pasty Christmas tree or ask if I could take a photo of it in case he said something other to me I did not like.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Gell97,Oxted,3,A little disappointing,"In the prime position in Padstow giving it the advantage over the many other 'Pasty' bakeries. 
Sadly there was a rather disinterested member of staff, grumpy really, which was a pity as the two ladies were bright, cheerful and enthusiastic. 
Our order was taken and heated up in their ovens for us. Only when we returned to our accommodation did we find that the gluten free pasty was the wrong one and the lamb and mint was rather gristly and not particularly flavoursome. 
Maybe because it is in the prime position it does not have to try very hard.

I had a Cornish pasty which was cooked to perfection, nice and hot with the nicest pastry and bursting with filling.

Ready and waiting to be heated through, no having to wait 30 minutes whilst they were made up out the back etc. Really good, full of ingredients and a lovely pastry, I removed the pasty from its plastic bag it had been heated in to cool it down in its paper bag and it fell apart so had to juggle with it to eat it but it was excellent.  As others have mentioned the staff also chose to ignore us when we entered for a good few minutes, not a good way to welcome customers at all, but if you are that popular and have people queuing then perhaps there is no need to smile or be engaging, so if you are the gentleman with the ""black earring"" you are the one that eventually served us, leave the sultriness to Polldark.",16/09/2018

Bought bags of hot breakfast rolls for the family every day which were huge and stuffed full of bacon etc. The bread and scones are lovely. The carrot cake was light and delicious, best I’ve ever had- but the Victoria sponge was heavy and the brownie far too dark for my teens to enjoy. Croissants very good. Traditional pasty very peppery but not unpleasant. 
Also loved the jar of passion fruit curd- had to buy more to take home. Look out for the sandwiches which are fresh, and very good value.

The facts -  the much raved about pasty , are ok , no better no worse than any of the numerous and much friendlier places selling them , the range of deli produce including chutneys and preserves are much more affordable than rick steins that is clearly evident , what is seriously lacking is any hint of politeness, customer service or  hint of civility!

This place was without-a-doubt the best Pasty shop I have ever been to. Over our week-long stay in Padstow, we worked our way through the standard Cornish steak pasty, steak & blue cheese and Chicken & Leek. All were outstanding. Much like us trying to find a seat in the busy harbour frankly.

Ignore the people moaning about the staff, you'd be a bit grumpy if you had to spend 7-days a week serving tourists too. Some people are just not people people. Whatever. It doesn't detract from the delicious wares on offer and they were so good we got a dozen to take home with us (that, I might add, filled the car with a heady aroma of meat, pepper and pastry. I'm surprised I managed to resist eating them all on the hard shoulder of the M6).

We are friendly polite people and purchased a box of mixed pasties and a couple extra. Bill came to nearly £70 - which is a bit pricey, but we wanted them. However we were served by the rudest off hand young lady you could possibly imagine. You might think this was a one off, but sadly not, we were served by an older lady a couple of days ago who was equally uninterested - had to wait in the empty shop to be noticed, after being given a stiff ignoring. Yes the pasties are nice, but we bought some lovely pasties from a lovely lady in the Padstow Pasty shop just around the corner on the same day. We went to the Chough Bakery again today to taste an award winning pasty. They may win awards for their pasties and indeed are trading off of their 2016 award winning pasties, BUT they certainly aren't going to win any awards for their customer service.

The lamb and mint is especially fine! But all the classic versions are excellent.

I ended up buying them both a sausage roll from Tesco (£1 each as opposed to the £2.20 the Chough charge) and they were wolfed down. The quiche wasn’t much better.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,616dominicl,London,1,Poor service but the male cashier.,"Went to Chough’s to get a pastie at lunchtime following a long bike ride. Could have gone to 1 of 5 or 6 bakeries in Padstow. Went to Chough’s because it was recommended. Won’t be going again. Walked through the door to a sign saying ‘use both tills’ so walked up to the right hand till managed by a man. The man looked up and said ‘there’s a line over there you’ll have to get to the back of it’ I said the sign says use either till. He said ‘not when there’s a line’. His manner was rude, off hand and aggressive. I went to stand behind the line he had pointed at. The woman on the other till looked up and mouthed ‘sorry’ and then served me. She was extremely kind and helpful. Why do people have to be like that. I suspect he didn’t care given the number of tourists that used the shop. I certainly won’t be going there again and I advise others not to as well.",04/07/2018

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Travelbug603,Bournemouth,1,Poor service so didn't bother,"Interested to read the review posted here earlier today as I had a very similar experience. Walked into an empty bakery save for two sales assistants who both saw me. A woman they knew came in and proceeded to gossip with both of them while I waited and waited to be served. The guy could win prizes for ignoring customers rather than the so called award winning pasties. Another group walked in and he asked if he could help them, seeing me, they invited me to go first. He looked through me and then resumed listening to the gossiper not serving any of us. At this point I walked out and we bought some delicious pasties around the corner. Reading some of the reviews on here though we may have had a lucky escape.",27/06/2018
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Paula F,Lincolnshire,2,If your appearance fits,"On my first visit to this bakery I was studiosly ignored by the chap behind the counter (reminded me of the actor Tim Curry), who eventually called someone over to serve me. A bought a loaf and very nice it was too. I visited again a couple of days later to buy some bread and this time he was on the phone and again completely ignored me; I was the only one at the counter. Shortly after three younger, well dressed (in polo casual style) came in and he immediately stopped what he was doing and asked them what they would like. I piped up that I wanted some bread and he still carried on looking at them. One of the young men gestured to me 'you first', but the guy still didn't come over and called me to the end of the counter. At this point I just shrugged and walked out. I went to Steins bakery around the corner for bread and saffron buns (fantastic) and the service was charming.",27/06/2018

Very nice too, lots of meat and great seasoning. Really enjoyed them, but the only thing I would say is the local seagulls make eating them by the harbour a nightmare. They are consistently looking to dive bomb and some are the size of cats. They have no fear, so keep an eye open for air raids, particularly on your youngsters. Not sure what the council can do about them but they are becoming a major nuisance here, taking away some of the enjoyment.",12/06/2018

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Brian C,St Austell,1,Worst pasty ever - and that includes Ginsters.,"So, enjoying the May Day 'Obby Oss celebrations and thought I'd buy a couple of pasties for me and the missus. What a mistake! For a start  they aren't cheap and then  the example I was given couldn't be described as a pasty. Being May Day I guess they were just turning them out as quickly as possible as mine wasn't properly cooked and fell apart in the bag. Unable to eat it I returned it to the shop with a description of what I thought (unprintable). My wife didn't even try to eat hers and that went back as well. I was so angry that I didn't waste my time asking for a refund but rest assured I will not visit the Chough Bakery again. This type of poor service will not go down well with tourists or indeed us locals. Probably best avoided as others we spoke to today said they were at best 'variable' in quality and sometimes only partly cooked which is what we experienced. Badly done Chough, badly done indeed.",01/05/2018

But we have been coming to Padstow for a few years and I noticed this yesterday and last time we were here, when you open the scones you are hit by the smell of margarine, and you can taste it as well. I’m no star baker but I do make scones and I would never in a million years use margarine!! All butter scones please! I know it’s probably more expensive but using margarine that smells and tastes that strong is just sacrilege!

The Chough Bakery,4.5,alanj21,,5,Fantastic Service,"we were staying in Padstow for a few days last week, and purchased 2 pasties from the Cornish pasty shop, as we walked along the harbour the local seagulls decided that my pasty was their choice of lunch, so one seagull took the pasty out of my hand and before it hit the ground a flock descended upon it.
I decided to buy another one to eat in the car and as we were by now outside Chough's bakery i went in to purchase another pasty, i explained what had happened to my original pasty and to my surprise the Saturday girls working there refused to charge me for my new pasty, which i thought was absolutely amazing, so thank you ladies for your fantastic customer service.
The down side for me was the pasty was absolutely fabulous,and my wife decided she would share it, so i only got half of the best pasty i have tasted for years",02/02/2018

The Chough Bakery,4.5,SusieBaby_10,Devon,5,Best Syrup Tart ever,"Staying in Newquay for Christmas, we ventured into Padstow on Christmas Eve and wanted a drink. Not knowing the area we followed a few people clutching coffee cups and pasties and found this little gem. Outside, was a table offering 'free' food in exchange for a voluntary Donation to the local Air Ambulance. I headed for the excellent Millionaires Shortbread, my husband chose a wedge of Treacle tart. After him saying it was the best he had ever tasted, I went inside and bought two more huge wedges to take back to our Hotel.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Chris C,Aylesbury Vale,4,Not just pasties,"I have tried the pasties here before, as part of wider research you understand. The pasties always stood with the best, and have been voted best in the near past. 
My second visit to the shop this trip was prompted by Chough’s presence at the Christmas festival, where they were giving out tasters of pretty much all their wares. We ended up coming home with a box of 12 pasties, 4 of their scones, a big cob loaf of their lovely bread, and jars of sweet chilli onion relish and piccalilli from their chutney range - so be warned, the shop is packed with temptation. If you only want a pasty it’s best to send someone else in! A recommendation also goes to their stollen cake which, might only be available at Christmas but has to be tried. 
The shop only loses a mark due to the indifference of the staff whenever I visit, but they’re in no way rude, and I suppose the fact is that the food is so lovely they don’t have to try too hard. ",12/12/2017

We also bought quiche however the quiche seemed a little undercooked so didn’t finish it the pasties were tepid and I have to say as a proper Cornish maid brought up on proper home made pasties I don’t not think my stomach was quite ready for a chough winning pasty 🙈in my opinion it’s not for me but don’t let that put you off it’s something you have to try yourself, the staff were lovely so for that I recommend the bakery however there are numerous places to try don’t stop at the first one you come to as did I!

They were very tasty and being Cornish and eaten many from different bakeries, I can honestly say, they are one of the best I've eaten. We also bought a loaf of bread, a sliced farmhouse.

However, it's exceptional attraction in recent years are its awarding-winning traditional Cornish pasties; these won the World Championship in 2016.
The Chough Bakery on the quayside is its retail-shop; it also has a wholesale business, distributing bread and Cornish pasties to a wide range of other outlets in North Cornwall.

Always had nice pasties and sandwiches although they were always significantly more expensive than the other pasty shops in Padstow of which there are at least 5!

This year we saw a new paint-job and counter extension. 

This meant that there was even more of a price hike! The pasties were all ordered at lunch time and were clearly from the previous day.....they were burnt, greasy and really chewy. My daughters was scorching hot but the rest of ours were treated to stone cold ones. My sons sausage roll was raw in the middle and the pastry was still under cooked. When we returned it, the man behind the counter was loathe to exchange as my son has taken a small bite......shocking !!!

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Rev_SimonHD,Stevenage,3,"Doughy Croissant, OK bread and moderate Pasties","The Chough boasts to have won medals for its Pasties and bread etc. so we were keen to try their produce. 

When I arrived soon after nine there was only one Croissant left, which I bought along with a loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry conserve. (This was the best thing we bought that day!)

Needing two Croissant I purchased another from a certain Chef's patisserie. I thought it would be interesting to compare the two. The one from Chough was doughy and barely ok. Indeed have had better from one of the supermarket chains!  The other was as close to those purchased from French patisseries as I have ever had. Indeed I could have been in France. 

The loaf was ok but nothing overly special. Of course being sliced and wrapped in a poly bag probably did it no favours, and on reflection I should have asked for a fresh unsliced loaf as I suspect the sliced loaves were from the day before. 

We bought Pasties on another day and were disappointed as the pastry was only so-so and the filling lacking in punchy flavour. Indeed I had a better one at the cafe at Kynance Cove!

So all in all a business resting on past success? I'm afraid I rather think so. Or maybe swamped by its success and losing its quality coping with demand?  Perhaps a kinder thought and maybe hope for the future if so.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,tripsandfood55,London,4,Very good - average / normal price - one of three we tried in Cornwall.  We would return!,"This was the first of three pasties we tried in Cornwall, with the help of Trip Advisor reviews.

We had a large traditional pastie at around 2.30pm  

They were able to heat it up (In an oven type system, NOT microwave) and after heating, the pastie still tasted like it had been freshly cooked (NOT soggy in any way!).

The amount of meat in the pastie was enough, as were the other ingredients.  It was filled as much as it could be with tasty ingredients.  It was huge!

The staff were friendly and the shop was very busy with prompt service.  A queue outside the door took around 1 minute, before they got to us.  Adding the heating of the pastie, we were away within a few minutes from queuing outside the door.

The outer part was a shortcrust pastry, but not as hard as some pasties we tried else where.  This was neither good nor bad for us as we like both types!

Cons
I would have preferred more seasoning.  However, I appreciate this being a difficult one to try to please everyone.

Now the staff have never been the friendliest -verging on the grumpy, but what really grinds my gears is their complete inability to keep their pasties hot once out the ovens.

They are simply put on trays and served. Now if you time it right you may get a hot one but 99 percent of time they are luke warm or cold. Awful!!!

How hard can it be in this day and age.

Sort it out Choughs!

For nearly £5 a pasty at least serve them hot!!!!!",14/08/2017

There is always (always) a queue but hey that's a great sign isn't it.  Staff are always pushed so don't expect a warm effusive welcome but you are only there to buy a pasty for heaven sake!

As usual the pasties were great, we visited quite early in the day so the full range was available.  The traditional, the lamb and the steak are our favourites.  They re-heat really well too so made for a good supper back at the holiday cottage. Also tried the jam doughnuts this time, which were fab.  The scones are also some of the best we've tasted, and we've tasted a lot on our visits to Cornwall.  By far the best place to buy a pasty (and much more) in the Padstow area.",30/07/2017

Was not disappointed. I had the large traditional pasty. The pastry was light and not heavy. The filling was packed from first bite to last with meat and veg. Apparently this bakery is approved by the Cornish Pasty Committee for producing the genuine Cornish Pasty. I am no expert but it was great.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,lolstar6,,3,"Nice Pasties, Rude Staff","Recently got back from a tour of beautiful Cornwall and visited Padstow on Sunday 16th July. We decided to try one of the award winning pasties, and it was clear the place was popular as very busy. 

We walked in and stood by the till, only to have a very sullen older lady from the other end of the counter bark "" I am serving over here as well you know"" with a miserable expression on her face. We apologised and stated that we didn't know as it wasn't very clear at all. 

My friends  cheese and onion pasty turned out to be cold, so she went back and asked for it to be warmed up. When approaching the man behind the counter she told him the situation and his response was ""Yeah?"" when she explained it was cold. He did get her another one, and my pasty was very nice,  but as I am stickler for good service and given the hundreds of pasty shops in Cornwall, I wouldn't return to this one. 

I get they are used to tourists, but we weren't rude, and I am a firm believer if you are polite, others should be aswell. Not impressed.

To be honest I didn't find Padstow - as pretty as it is - a particularly friendly place in comparison to other Cornish towns. We went into The Teddy Bear shop round the corner and my friend asked to look a bear in window display, the woman there was also a ray of sunshine. 

Maybe we just went on a bad day.",20/07/2017

Light pastry, filling filled crimp, a filling which has good meat content but even better a balanced content of meat and vegetable where the mixture is the delight.

Another great eat is their apricot slices: full of apricots and very moreish. Avoid eating your pasties in the harbour just outside the bakery as it gets very crowded. Take them instead past the harbour and up the park following the path to the beach. It is 6-8 mins walk but there are plenty of benches to seat on and the views of the town down below are superb.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,NatF189,Wolverhampton,4,5* Food. Service is questionable.,"We always use Chough Bakery whenever we visit Cornwall. Have done for years.
The quality of their pasties is amazing. The pastry, the filling and the crust on them tastes amazing. My whole family love them.
We always place an order to collect on the last day of our holiday so we can bring some Pasties back with us. 
Also we have the scones from there too and they literally melt in your melt. Such a lovely taste! 
The only downside to this place are the staff. They are so miserable. And considering the one day we ordered 12 pasties to bring home and bought 4 for us to eat then, an order that come to over £60 you would be grateful for abit of good customer service! But unfortunately you dont seem to get this. Visited twice whilst on holiday and both times. Same person. And bad service.
Sort this out and your bakery would be even more outstanding!

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Ashley W,Telford,2,Cold and hardly any meat,"We visited today as it was our last day in padstow and thought we would treat our selves to a pasty from this bakery, we had one minted lamb and one traditional pasties. 
The minted lamb pasty was very cold which we took that one back in to either get a hotter one or warm ours up, they warmed ours back up which is okay but we would of preferred to have a new hot one, then the traditional pasty had plenty of filling but it was like 5% or less of meat and the other 95% veg etc.
The pasties then repeated on us both all day, to which we both agree we will try another pasty shop in padstow rather then this one. We have had chough before and it was nice but on this occasion it has put us off. We know they are busy but doesn't mean they can serve cold food.

Still hot from the oven, our medium traditional was stuffed with properly seasoned potato cut into squares rather than cubes, layered with good chunks of beef. The pastry was firm but thin and held the filling well to the last bite. So good, we went back for another. Just checking for consistency!",20/11/2016

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Nicole N,,2,"Reheated Pasty, burnt mince pies ","We went to the chough twice on our visit to Padstow. The first time we brought a box of mince pies recommended to us by the really friendly lady in the shop. The mince pies were amazing. Because of this a few days later we decided to pick a couple of boxes up as a gift for family. 
But when we got home we realised that they were burnt on one side and tasted nothing like the first batch. 
On the same day we got steak pasties. We got told they had cooled down we could have them reheated. While waiting for them to be reheated we could see fresh pasties coming out of the oven. The bakery should have offered us fresh pasties or a reduction in price on the cold ones. This isn't what I would expect from an award winning pasty shop. 
If you get this bakery on a good day it's great but sadly yesterday wasn't a good day. ",17/11/2016
The Chough Bakery,4.5,KJBMTB,Woodley,4,Nice Pasty,"This was our first trip to Padstow and was fascinated by the number of Pasty shops in close proximity of themselves. In fact there were 3 next to each other in one street. We decided we would try one for lunch and bought one from Chough's and sat around the harbour eating it takeaway style!

It was very tasty and full of meat. A first class pasty.",16/11/2016

The Chough Bakery,4.5,StuartWeybridge,London,1,Disinterested / microwaved pastie,"On entering the shop ""that apparently has award winning pasties"" we were met by a very matter of fact and disinterested owner (the mother I think). Who asked if she could help. We asked for a cheese and leek, onion pastie. Would you like that warm she asked.. on saying yes please she promptly headed off and placed the pastie in a microwave. 
While waiting for the pastie to be heated. She then returned to the shop asking if she could help us?? 
Another minute went by and a hot pastie was handed over so we headed off to the nearest bench for our award winning snack.. Now if there's an award for uncooked pastry read hot filling with a disgusting texture they win hands down.
We returned the pastie to the shop and didn't get any comment from staff when advised of the poor quality.. However this was expected considering how we were met at time of purchase .. 
It's only £3.. But next time I would rather put the money in a charity box and give it to the needy not the unwelcoming greedy..",15/11/2016

The pasty itself consisted of a thin pastry crust, unlike many where the main ingredient is a thick crust, filled with a good blend of meat, potatoes etc. Again so many pasties are full of potato, and lack hardly any meat.
Reasonable prices are charged for this quality product.",10/11/2016

It was as if I had asked her to give up her life for me (checking her phone obviously more important than customers).  Apparently just won an award.

My sister got hers first and then a lady pushed in front of me however the young girl with blonde hair serving had clearly seen me waiting. The young girl serving then looked at me and walked off out the back where she was just doodling around the shop started filling up and she came back out. Obviously embarrassed that she had made me wait she asked what I would like no manners included mind. She then gave me one of the flattest pasties I've ever seen in my life, she did not say please or thankyou when taking my money and straight away asked who was next. I said well can I have a bag then please and she just put it I front of me. Shame that locals are treated so poorly in the town, I think I will stay away from the cough from now on.",08/09/2016

I wasn't disappointed, but I wouldn't say it's the best pasty I've had. Maybe the 'dollop of cream' mentioned in the recipe is an acquired taste, it certainly wasn't to mine. Not peppery enough, but I'd have another any day. Not so impressive was a Chicken, leek and bacon pasty which didn't have anywhere near enough chicken or bacon in it. ""Leek and Potato"" would have been a better description and, again, not peppery enough.

Very very little meat in them and a bit bland in our opinion. No better than any of the competitors. Shame as I remember Chough bakery 15 years ago and it was great; much more authentic.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Anne L,London,2,The Chough Bakery - Cornish Pasty World Champions 2016 - not!,"My friends and I were staying in Polperro but decided to take a trip to Padstow during our week away and chose The Chough Bakery to buy some Cornish Pasties.

Apparently,  Alex Polizzi helped them in a BBC programme, I never saw it so can't comment on if Alex did a good job or not.  I can though comment on their Cornish Pasties and their service.

The guy who served us was friendly, smiley, but did seem in a rush to move us on so he could serve the next customer.  As for the Cornish Pasty itself, there is a board outside claiming the bakery won the '2016 Best Cornish Pasty In The World' competition.  I did not agree, and neither did my friends.

The pasties we bought from The Chough Bakery were horrible, their pastry was thick and doughy, the filling was not moist but dry and so tasteless..  How they got the coveted title of 'Best Cornish Pasty In The World' is a mystery.

Would I recommend The Chough Bakery for their Cornish Pasties?  NO.  I would suggest the customer travel to Looe and taste the Cornish Pasties at Sarah's Pasty Shop instead, then they will know how good a Cornish Pasty is supposed to be.",10/07/2016

It read well on the shop's description great with just the right ingredients even with a dollop of Cornish Clotted Cream on the ingredients prior to cooking.

I was a little disappointed as the vegetable content was a little on the 'al dante' side and there didn't seem to be the right amount of meat.

Perhaps it's me! as this bakery has received 2016 awards and good reviews from customers.

Last year we found a very good Cornish Pasty in St Ives but sadly so far this year have not been able to match it. 
Will keep trying to find the elusive best Cornish Pasty.",20/06/2016

Situated right opposite the harbour it is the best bet for a reasonably priced and filling take-away lunch.  Various testimonials adorn the windows, including one proclaiming them as Pasty Champion for 2016 and as soon as the shop opens you will see customers bearing away boxes and boxes of the prizewinning item.  The smell and sight of trays of passes emerging from the ovens is intoxicating and I defy you not to be overcome by the urge to indulge.  Unlike the greasy products on every high street, the pasties here are made with chunks of meat and vegetables, not the industrial sludge to which you may be accustomed.  Be warned if leaving town on a Sunday: Choughs is not open and you will need to plan ahead.  Fortunately, past experience tells me that they are still delicious 48 hours after purchase!",07/04/2016

The staff are friendly, helpful and chatty, making sure to give you tips on which pasties have just come fresh out of the oven. Yes, the pasty selection is small, but wide selection does not necessarily mean good pasties (I'm looking at you Pasty Presto). Choughs know and love what they do, and they do it brilliantly. 
Handily, they also do a bulk delivery service if you ever want pasties for parties etc., which is well organised and reliable.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Sandy M,London,1,Dreadful front-of shop service,"We have been regular visitors to Padstow for a number of years now and my husband has, from time to time, bought a pastie at The Chough. We have had no complaints until now - the pasties have always been tasty and they were served up on request or it was made clear that they would be ready in 10-15 minutes. We have just spent another week in the area and invited a close relative along who wanted to try a traditional Cornish pastie. We recommended The Chough, of course. We went in at about 12.30 p.m. - there was one customer ahead of us and another to follow so it was very quiet at that point and our order was pretty straightforward. We stated our order clearly to the assistant and waited, and waited whilst she then ignored us and just stared into the kitchen area. We assumed that she was waiting for fresh pasties and was dealing with our order. At that point, my husband left the shop to wait outside as nothing appeared to be happening. As more people came in, we could see that they were being served ahead of us by another younger assistant.  I presumed at that point that they had asked for other types of pastie.Then the assistant who was meant to be serving disappeared, then started dealing with other customers whilst we were still being ignored!!! I protested (politely) that we were still waiting for our order. I phoned my husband who had, by then, given up and had gone back to the car to wait. We attracted the attention of the younger member of staff (yet again) and she apologised and assured us that we would be attended to as soon as possible. Fine - only to be told that there were no traditional pasties left and that we would have to wait another 10 minutes for the pasties that we ordered well over 20 minutes ago! We went elsewhere.  Having read earlier reviews, I can see that we are not the first to experience this shoddy level of customer service. I left the shop feeling angry and let down and vowed never to go back.",02/01/2016

The disappointment did kick in at the bakery,the staff were not very interested in customer relations at all,it appeared that they did not want to be there ! Let alone serve customers.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Russell B,Manchester,3,Former glory?,"This place was once my favourite Cornwall pasty shop. It got to the stage that I'd pop into Padstow just to get one. Whilst in the area earlier this week I ended up doing it again.

Sadly my medium sized traditional pasty significantly failed to live up to expectations.

The pastry was heavy and dry, the filling was bland and ordinary, the whole product wasn't a patch on its former glory. Truly disappointed.

Even in winter time Cornwall is awash with numerous pasty entrepreneurs, competition is fierce. I've sampled both ends of the scale over recent times, some pasties are rubbish, others, such as Sarah's at Looe, are truly wonderful. As for my old favourite in Padstow I'm afraid on this showing the best reference I can provide it with is under average. When you consider the cost it somewhat fails the value for money test.

Shame really as I genuinely liked this place in years gone by.",10/12/2015
The Chough Bakery,4.5,TheRestroomCritic,Chichester,5,Very disappointing,"Nice woman serving but utterly useless, sorry to say. Eventually bought two pasties but the pastry was horrible, heavy and bland pastry. They were fed to the seagulls.
Really, £7 for two pasties is a lot and you expect a bit more, especially considering how many other pasty shops there are in Padstow.
Very poor, very disappointing and would recommend giving this bakery a miss.",09/12/2015

Upon entering the shop a young person was serving the customer in front.  An older lady was stood by the till chatting to staff in the back and by now there were 5 other customers behind me, She finally stopped talking and acknowledged myself and the other customers but only after one had left and I was about to leave.  I did purchase two medium pasties which were quite enjoyable but the service leaves a lot to be desired and with all the other pasty shops around I think I will try a few of the competitors before returning",23/11/2015

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Mrs-Watercress,London,4,The Best Pasties in Cornwall,"When I booked my holiday in Padstow, one of the items at the top of my list of things to do was to try a Cornish Pasty.  Chough (pronounced 'Chuff' apparently) Bakery seemed to be the highest rated in the area so we went there first.  

The bakery is situated right on the harbour in a wonderful old blue and white building. 

We both had a traditional steak pasty, which contained beef, swede, onions and potato.  They were huge and I think they must have just come out of the oven because they were really hot and remained hot all the way through.  

The pastry was lovely and thin and soft and didn't overpower the flavour of the meat and veg.  My only disappointment was that mine had very little meat compared to my partner's pasty which was absolutely packed with it.  Mine seemed to mainly contain potato and swede with just a bit of meat here and there.  Nevertheless, it was cooked to perfection and was still the tastiest of the three pasties I tried while in Cornwall.  I am very tempted to buy a box through their mail order service.",01/10/2015

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Travel Critic,United Kingdom,4,Consistently good,"Cornish pasties have evolved over the years to provide for so many varying tastes,but I believe that a true test of fresh pasty making is by tasting a traditional recipe. 

How many times have we been disappointed when we tuck into the pastry to find so little meat we could almost call it a vegetable pasty or even swede and onion pasty!

Well, not with the Chough Bakery certainly in my experience anyway, I've never been disappointed (except once when there seemed to be a lack of Pepper) but I've had so many over the years that have been just perfect one could hardly complain. The filling is generous, and yes there IS meat inside.

Their skill in producing a traditional pasty is the foundation they have to produce excellent variations both savoury and sweet but I will always return to the meaty Cornish variety.",24/09/2015

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Roger5668,Ipswich,2,disappointing pasty,After enjoying a Chough past here last year I was determined to have another one this year and avoid the other pasty outlets in Padstow.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Andy W,Princes Risborough,5,Perfect pasties,It is hard to believe how much this place has improved from years back. The pasties are some of the best I have had in Cornwall with plenty of filling and a nice spicy flavour. Great tucker on a breezy day out in Padstow.,08/07/2015
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Martin S,Castleford,5,Fantastic pasties,"We've holidayed in Cornwall for several years now and have tried out numerous pasties in our quest to find the best. All of this has played a little bit of havoc with my waistline, but without doubt these are the best we've had. Generously filled, perfectly cooked meat and veg, and the important bit, beautifully moist. Not the longest pasty menu in Padstow, but this year we've had the pleasure of traditional steak, lamb and mint, along with my own personal favourite, steak and Cornish Blue cheese. I think they do a couple of veggie options too and we've also tried the bread and scones and been thoroughly delighted.

There's generally a queue to be served but plenty of staff who all work efficiently and exchange pleasantries, so the aromas from the ovens don't tease for too long. This is a bakery and so although the pasties are hot, you need to find a bench or a wall, or avoid unwanted attention from the gulls and take them back with you.

In the commercial empire that Padstow has become, it's really good to find somewhere that offers something traditional at a reasonable price. Something for the people. Of course, clearly some prefer a chicken tikka filling, or in line with the current trend, pulled pork. All of this is available around the corner. At the other end of the scale, I'm sure you can find a 'proper' restaurant where a delicate pasty is served on a lovely china plate with a little garnish of limp leaves. I bet you'll pay a lot more than we did (circa seven quid for two pasties to go). But for me, it's a bit like fish and chips at the seaside tasting  better in the newspaper they're wrapped in. A hot pasty, a glorious view, some fresh air and a gentle breeze. Perfect.",30/06/2015

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Ruby H,Wrentham,5,First time we've tried pasties ,"As this was the first time we had pasties, it was exciting to try ones by the bakery that had been featured on TV. We had a 'Traditional Cornish' and a Beef and Blue Cheese. Both came in 'medium' which was HUGE, both were very tasty for a meal which wasn't pre-browned, and the meat was obviously top-notch because it melted in the mouth. What we must not ignore too was how mouth-wateringly good the Chough's Millionaire's Shortbread was for 'afters'! Plus, we successfully avoided getting bombed and robbed by Padstow's resident seagulls by staying close to a wall. Eat these on a bench out in the open at your peril! The seagulls WILL get your lunch. Improvements? More 'small' pasties please. The medium was too large. ",04/06/2015

So i thought ""lets go and help them too ""rather than go to ricks bakers. 
Well.. A lady kind of served me. More interested with wrapping someones quiche than actually talking to me. I asked if they had any croissants as there were none on display. The lady asked the baker and she said no we didn't put any in the oven, As it was raining and we thought nobody will want croissants. So i said ok and is it possible to order a few for tomorrow ?
Yes she replied and took my order and i left.
The next day i arrived to collect my order and i was told there was a problem . They only had two plain croissants. And one was an almond one. So i said thats fine. I don't mind . ""Really!?

The bakery looks good in terms of the frontage and inside it has a cosy rustic feel. It is very inviting. However the staff were stand offish and the guy I spoke to lacked communication skills. I imagined this to be a premium establishment from the look of it however I was disappointed. I expected a conversation about the various pasties on offer but I got unhelpful one word responses. He just was not interested in talking. I wouldn’t have minded ordinarily but the place was empty.

I also had to wait a long time for the order to arrive. Anyway I bought some Cornish blue pasties and I distributed them out to my family. We sat on a bench in front of market square. We were all disappointed by the taste and texture of the pasties and wished we hadn’t had them. There were lots of other people having there lunches which looked more appetising.

It would have been better to bring our own sandwiches. Although this bakery looks the part of a high class establishment it isn’t. It is just a greasy fast food outlet beneath the lovely façade.",06/10/2014

Standing in front of the counter looking at the lack of baked goods which seems to be more restricted at every visit in particular the apple baked sponge, the young girl serving said ""what can I get you"" no good morning no smile, I responded asking what was inside the doughnut which to that she replied sarcastically ""jam"" her lack of smile and customer service instantly put me and my partner off and we walked out of the shop without a purchase.

Admittedly it was a bank holiday but there was no order in the serving, staff were not welcoming and avoiding eye contact and, whilst waiting in the shop, we were barged out of the way by customers who were also frustrated by the complete chaos caused by lack of organisation. This is in stark contrast to the other pasty/bread outlets in Padstow. We were not the only ones to leave and, like them will not be trying the experience again.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Lisadrury7,Southampton,4,The best pasties!! Simple.,"Love this tiny, family run bakery. They don't do a lot, but what they do is near perfect. The steak pasty is simply Devine, better than anything else you'll ever taste. Even better than steins. 
If the chough bakery purchased an up to date Italian coffee machine and served great coffee it would clear up. ",19/05/2014
The Chough Bakery,4.5,JaneNorthsomerset,,1,Awful customer service,"We visit Padstow a lot  but I can honestly say the so called boss lady who failed too serve me had such a rude attitude. I asked her for the cakes I wanted, she totally ignored me walked out the back continued to put aprons in a bag for a member of staff who was stood by her giving him instructions. I was stood there like a lemon. She then came back to the counter picked up a paper bag looked at me then turned her back on me and carried on her conversation with this colleague.  At this point I walked out the shop. So so rude I will never shop there again. I walked round the corner to Presto pastys such a friendly helpful shop.",17/05/2014

The Chough Bakery,4.5,MikeT106,Chipping Norton,5,BEST PASTIES EVER,We were on holiday last week at Mother Ivey's Caravan Park. The shop on the site sells Chough pasties and bread. I had two pasties during the week and they were both superb. Most pasty makers in Cornwall put the beef in one large lump but the Chough beef was mixed in with the rest of the filling which means that every mouthful contains both beef and vegetables.,10/05/2014

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Zoe L,,4,Cornwall pasties - in my opinion the best in Padstow,Just come back from Padstow and still the Chough bakery are delivering excellent pasties. The only thing not allowing me to give a 5/5 overall was that all their pasties on both times were cold ( whether they were having problems with ovens I don't know) however that certainly didn't detract from the excellent quality of the product. Good to see that they have introduced some different flavours to attract a wider audience. See you again next your Chough Bakery,03/05/2014

It was our first time to the area having been on a mini break in North Devon. We used the park and ride for £4 at the top of town next to Tesco which took us right to the centre on a double decker, which the kids loved. Buses were every 10 minutes.  My husband had been looking forward to a pasty from here for ages before we came and he wasn't disappointed! We both had a traditional steak pasty, which were both excellent, well seasoned, with good pastry.  Top notch!  Typically being a Bank Holiday, the bakery had sold out of most things, but from their website I see they do mail order, so we'll get a chance to try out the others!",22/04/2014

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Ian M,Fareham,5,The best pasties in the UK,"I would normally advise anybody buying a pastie:  ""always buy a pastie from a butcher, not a baker"".  After all, we've all seen the pastries filled with grey peppery mush from Greggs et al.

But, these are heavenly pasties, with real, recognisable pieces of meat in there.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Lookslikerain,Nailsea,5,What a pasty!!,"Visited Padstow on the way back to Bristol. The little town was heaving with us grockles. The queue at Rick Stein's Fish and Chip shop was immense (and he doesn't do the cooking) and so we went to Chough's for a pasty. 

Now there's pasties and then there's PASTIES. I've eaten pasties before but this was my first PASTY. Just piping hot, full of meat, cooked on the premises and as fresh as fresh can be. Absolutely the bestest pasty ever to be had in Cornwall.We both had the lamb with leek and mint gravy. Large chunks of meat with slices of leek cooked to perfection and a gravy that was just so.

If you want food on the go and you don't want to wait for Cod and Chips go to Chough's and £3.45 for a large pasty you'll not be disappointed.",01/11/2013

I found the small were just right for me and the medium for my husband - the large looked enormous! In fact I've bought some and put them in the freezer to give us a taste of Padstow.

I walked into the shop with a pretty vague reception which is fine as it was nearing the end of the day. As I paid I was asked if I wanted to buy a pasty and as I'm vegetarian I asked the lady if the pastry was suitable for vegetarians, her response ""I don't know"" she had to ask someone in the kitchen. It didn't fill me with confidence so I declined. An average shop with average offerings - I really wanted to be a fan but unfortunately not. ",26/09/2013

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Blueroom1,,3,Trading on the past?????,"This bakery I think has again lost its way. Been here a few times and the service seems to be getting worse. The food is so good, pastry and cakes but no one wants to serve it to you with a smile, and in summer too. They were featured on the restaurant inspector on telly and Alex Polizzi took them to task and apparently it worked for a while, but sustaining it is what matters after the cameras have all gone. Bit disappointing given the position and the quality of the merchandise on sale.",28/08/2013

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Mary C,Rochester,3,Delicious but slow,We reserved pasties and saffron cake and they'd totally seemed to have no idea about it when we arrived to collect. All ok in the end and collected fine but slightly annoying.,23/08/2013
The Chough Bakery,4.5,dcough2005,London,4,Delicious quiche but staff looked miserable,"Popped in to buy a quiche for a picnic which was delicious.  Let down by staff who looked sullen, showed no enthusiasm and a can't be asked attitude despite the shop not being very busy at the height of season.  They should be sent round to Rick Stein's for training.  Mary Portas recently visited this shop in one of her programmes.  Maybe the customer service part was ignored by Chough's.  A pity because the pastry is fantastic.",23/08/2013

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Marie C,,4,Gorgeous food but staff could maybe be happier!,"We visited this bakery yesterday.  I live in Cornwall and had a cream tea sent by post from here to my mother in law in Yorkshire for mothers day this year.  She thoroughly enjoyed it and as they are down visiting we thought we'd go there for a pasty.  Loads of choice on the lunch front, they do your regular cornish pasty in 3 sizes, a lamb + mint one, steak and cornish blue cheese, chicken leek bacon and cheese, cheese leek and onion, vegetable and a couple more I can't remember!  they also do sausage rolls, quiche, lots of different breads, cakes and scones (we bought some to bring home).  On the whole it was delicious, the only very slight negative was when we asked if the bread we had bought could be sliced and we were answered with a very blunt no.  Nevertheless we bought it anyway and the in laws sliced it up themselves.  I would definitely visit here again as the pasties are scrummy and I look forward to wroking my way through the flavours!",19/08/2013
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Suzie P,Cheltenham,4,Best pasty in Padstow,"After trying pastys from all the shops available in Padstow and Rock we have found these to be the best.

I would particularly recommend the lamb and mint pasty.",14/08/2013

The Chough Bakery,4.5,peacemakerukuk,Godalming,4,Best pasty ever tasted,We went with the ratings on Tripadvisor to lead us in where to go for a lunchtime pasty and I'm so glad we did.  The only reason I didn't give it full marks was because at 11.30 they didn't have any of the cheese and leek or fresh vegetable pasty's - surely approaching lunchtime there should be supply all the time of all the varieties?  Other than that my steak pasty was chock full of tasty ingredients and even the crust didn't seem thick and doughy - just fantastic.  I can see why there are such queues and I'm glad we got there when we did but just a shame about the lack of variety available when we were there.,11/08/2013
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Blooms,Yeovil,5,Best pasty I've EVER tasted,"If your a pasty lover look no further than Chough pasty's, they are the best. You could taste the butter that they'd sauted the onions in. They just taste so good.  No wonder they win so many awards. ",11/08/2013

This is definitely the best place to buy (we have tried the other pasty shops in Padstow and they were rubbish in comparison!)
We had the Lamb, Mint & Leak and the traditional Cornish Pasty both were amazing.
We will definitely be back next year and will recommend to everyone.
I wish I'd thought of bringing some home with us!",05/08/2013
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Sealfeast,Horfield,5,Best pasty in padstow,"Whenever I visit padstow I am sure to get a delicious pasty from here everytime. It's pretty obvious it's the favourite as there is always a short queue. As for the price, it's not over priced at all. 
I didn't go for the generic traditional pasty, but feasted on a lamb and mint and It was very good. I would recommend going to this bakery as its the best :) ",04/08/2013
The Chough Bakery,4.5,jasonh78,Bideford,2,Too Expensive!!,"Padstow is a wonderful place, and i fully understand the need for businesses in holiday areas to make a living when the sun shines ( I am in the industry myself, so fully understand the situation). However £3.95 for a Cornish pasty is outragous!! 

My home town of Bideford has Blackwell Pasties who have been in constant business for 25 years, and their offering is half the price. Shame on you Choughs!!",02/08/2013

The Chough Bakery,4.5,asarkar,,5,The perfect bakewell tart,"Like most visitors to this bakery, we queued up to buy cornish pasties to enjoy by the harbour. After eating pasties at various places during our one week stay in Cornwall, I can definitely vouch that the steak pasties we had here were the best we have had. 

The display counter area of the bakery was quite busy. It being a beautiful sunny day at Padstow, there were many visitors at the harbour. The staff were very professional - answering customer queries, being quite welcoming and giving sufficient time for the customers to make up their mind. At the same time they were quick to serve, trying to keep the queue short. 

Being a keen home baker, I couldn't resist the temptation to buy a slice of bakewell tart. This turned out to be the best decision of the day! The tart was baked to perfection. The bottom was not soggy at all in spite of the pastry base being very thin. The texture of the pastry was just perfect. The almond flakes were generously distributed, yet the taste wasn't overpowering. The hint of raspberry left a sweet lingering aftertaste that lasted in my mouth for a long time after the slice had vanished. 

I would love to learn how to bake a perfect tart the way they do at the Chough Bakery. I wish they offered some cookery lessons.",18/07/2013

One is enough to satisfy the heartiest appetite and my advice is to take as many home as will travel well and fit in your freezer, Recommended unreservedly.",04/07/2013

Having seen the reviews on Trip Advisor and having tried some of the other pasty vendors, this is the best in my opinion.

Most mornings, I would pop down about 8:30 and get a selection of buns and breads. By the 3rd day we were on the Traditional Pasty breakfast! We just couldnt resist. The loaction ensures that it gets the maximum footfall possible and for this reason it is a very busy little shop.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,SaucyHorse,Flackwell Heath,2,Sitting on their laurels?,We often visit Padstow and have bought pasties here before which were good. On the most recent occasion the range available was small and we were told we'd have to wait 10 minutes before the next batch of steak pasties came out (surely a best seller?) and even then they couldn't tell me if any would be available to buy as they had an order waiting. i explained I'd like to know if they could or could not fulfill our order there and then as I didn't want to wait 10 minutes only to be disappointed. They were rather short and said they couldn't tell me and I'd have to wait. Obviously it wasn't possible to open the oven door and see how many they had in!! If the staff had been a little more pleasant I probably would have waited. As they were rather arrogant I went round the corner to The Pasty Company and bought 6 excellent steak and tribute pasties which were gorgeous. A case of needing a little work on front of house I think.,04/01/2013

You often have to wait for them to come out of the oven due to the popularity of this place - but that just means you always get a fresh and hot pasty. The pastry is delicious. The service is good and it's also reasonably priced. If you want a good cornish pasty walk past the chain shops in the town and go here!
The bread is pretty good too!",06/01/2013
The Chough Bakery,4.5,SaucyHorse,Flackwell Heath,2,Sitting on their laurels?,We often visit Padstow and have bought pasties here before which were good. On the most recent occasion the range available was small and we were told we'd have to wait 10 minutes before the next batch of steak pasties came out (surely a best seller?) and even then they couldn't tell me if any would be available to buy as they had an order waiting. i explained I'd like to know if they could or could not fulfill our order there and then as I didn't want to wait 10 minutes only to be disappointed. They were rather short and said they couldn't tell me and I'd have to wait. Obviously it wasn't possible to open the oven door and see how many they had in!! If the staff had been a little more pleasant I probably would have waited. As they were rather arrogant I went round the corner to The Pasty Company and bought 6 excellent steak and tribute pasties which were gorgeous. A case of needing a little work on front of house I think.,04/01/2013
The Chough Bakery,4.5,DevonKaz,,2,Dont know whats happened here,"We recently  had a pasty from here and it was terrible. It was bland, lacked salt, not much beef. Dont know whats happened here . We had one in the summer and it was lovely. To top it off a seagull flew down and grabbed my hubbys. pasty. Maybe that was a good thing on the occasion. Please improve or you will lose customers",19/12/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,celinabees,Portsmouth,5,My first pasty in Cornwall was a great experience,"My last day in Padstow I was determined to find what looked like a shop selling traditional pasties and not a chain store. I stumbled upon this place, and it looked the business, so I ordered two meat pasties to take back with me to Portsmouth on the train.  The smell filled the whole train with the wonderful aroma, that I gave in and ate mine before I even got home.  It was wonderful and everything I had hoped.  Going back down in February and will be buying some more of this Cornish wonder!",09/12/2012

We rectified that this time, and they are the best to be had in Padstow - proper, traditional Cornish Pasties, full of beef and potato and plenty of pepper.  Nothing fancy, no extra ingredients or flavouring, just a pasty as it's meant to be.
The ready made sandwiches are sublime.
I found the staff cheerful and willing.",24/09/2012

The Chough Bakery,4.5,BuzzardFlight,Coventry,4,Tastiest pasty I had during week in North Cornwall,"Once we'd checked into our B&B we strolled down to the harbour to get a snack. Had a quick look at a few of the many pasty shops around the harbour (there are three next to each other not far from this one!) and just decided that The Chough looked the most appealing. Both choosing the traditional steak pasties, we found them very tasty, with good quality meat, well seasoned and thoroughly enjoyed them.

Our only problem was finding somewhere to sit and eat them in the middle of Padstow on a Sunday afternoon that wasn't packed with people and their dogs!",17/09/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Biriyaniboy B,Newbury,4,Damn fine pasties and bread!,"If there is one good reason to visit Padstow then this must be it. Been here on and off over last few years and the newly made over shop front drags Choughs up to date. 
Pasties have never disappionted with my personal favourite the steak and blue cheese although the traditional is also very well received with good mix of steak, root veg and seasoning. 

Its also good to see the bakery supplying some other local outlets! Their bread is wonderfully fresh and tasty as are their scones and buns. 
",14/09/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Matt,East Midlands,4,Top pasties!,"We went here in preference to the myriad other pasty shops in Padstow as we had seen the family who own it being ripped to shreds by Alex Polizzi on the TV. Not a particularly sound reason, granted, but it proved a good choice anyway! My wife had the steak pasty and I had the cheese, onion and leek version and they were both very nice indeed! Not bad value either - one large and one medium for £6.50. Highly recommended, as the queue out of the door and down the road will testify! ",11/09/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Jill,Ilfracombe,3,What a let down,"We have had the pasties before and were lovely then - now they taste (I suppose what they are ) mass produced and the pastry was horrid.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Karen,Kent,5,Excellent!,"The queue coming out of the door enticed us in! We were not disappointed. I had the medium traditional pasty and it was delicious. Maybe I was lucky but it was full of tender steak. My husband and teenagers went for the chicken, smoked bacon, cheese and leek pasty which they said was 'okay' but nothing special.
The other goodies in the bakery looked lovely and would definately visit again if in the area.",03/09/2012

The Chough Bakery,4.5,dh120,Oxford,4,Not just pasties,"Everybody is reviewing the pasties...Well we just spent a week in Cornwall and not a pasty in sight! 

What I can say is that the Chough serves some tasty cakes. We bought the brownie and millionaire shortbread for a walk on the coast path - the shortbread was very good but the brownie was nearly the best I've ever had. I can't say the best because if my girlfriend reads this then I'm in trouble. We did think it was on the pricey side (£3.20 for two small cakes) but I suppose this is what you get with a harbour-front location.

Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to pop back and buy their recipe book but we'll look out for it on a later trip.",30/08/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,LollyGoggins,Exeter,3,Just average,"Whilst on a trip to Padstow and having read all the reviews we headed here first at lunch time.  But I must say we were a bit disappointed.  Not the outstanding pasties we were expecting.  We had the traditonal cornish pastie, which was expensive and mainly just full of potato, not much meat at all.  Also could have been tastier.  I am guessing the only reason it is popular is it's position right on the harbour front.  If it was in one of the streets behind, like the other pastie shops it wouldn't have the queues.  It's just that it's conveniently placed.  Also the service was lack-lustre.  We would head somewhere else next time.",28/08/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Matt S,Bournemouth,4,Nice as always,"I have been coming to Padstow for around 35yrs and have had pasties from the chough bakery I would say at least 50 times. The only issue I had this year was that the traditional pasty I selected seemed to be an almost vegetarian pie as i only found 3 pieces of small steak in it.

My wife however had the cocktail version and found a lump of steak almost half the size of the pasty??

A little more quality control is needed I think.",27/08/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Steve Z,Milton Keynes,5,Well Chuffed With The Chough,"Having only used the Chough sporadically over a number of years we visited this year following their appearance on a well known TV show having a catering business makeover. 

We were welcomed into the attractive premises, were told in the street that their pasties were fantastic by a member of the public and we bought scones, quiche, cream and sausage rolls.

All were of fantastic quality and the sausage rolls were the best we as a family have ever tasted. The scones were equally as good......we done to The Chough Bakery for their turnaround and the queues are a clear sign of the success.....we would highly recommend!!!",25/08/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,TheSconnoisseur,,5,Best Pasties in Cornwall,"Just fantastic! We actually found their pasties stocked in a little coffee shop in Port Isaac before finding their shop in Padstow. There pastry is really great by itself, not just a casing for the filling like so many others. The traditional Cornish pasty filling was really good quality, large chunks of meat, not a mass of minced junk. Big thumbs up Chough - we saw you on TV earlier in the year and were not disappointed. Will be ordering from you online now too :-)",21/08/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Jasper050,Cheltenham,2,"Average, there's better round the corner....","OK, so while in Padstow you have to have a Pasty and after watching Alex Polizzi doing her stuff on The Chough we thought we had better give it a go.

We had a traditional and some cheese and onion pasties.  I have to say that we were really dissapointed.  Don't get me wrong,  they were OK and filling but pretty tasteless.  too much veg and not much meat in the traditional.

My advice? Go round the corner and get a better and cheaper one from Pasty Presto. Have eaten from there over many years and never faulted their pasties.",17/08/2012
The Chough Bakery,4.5,Yes_Chef2,Fleet,5,Excellent pasty,"High recommend, possibly the best pasties in Cornwall - the queues at lunchtime pay testament to this fact.

I have looked at many of the other reviews who appear to think the pasties are ""the best in the world""

Sadly I beg to differ. The ones we had were good, although not the same temparature throughout. A little less than hot in parts. Sadly my wife and I got very bad indigestion and couldn't een eat in the evening.

The least appealing part of the experience was the attitude of the staff, which we found rather unfriendly and curt. A shame as I was looking forward to our visit after the TV programme. I think there's still a long way to go.",16/03/2012

The Chough Bakery,4.5,amybunny,,3,A divine morsel of Cornwall,"Chough's Cornish Pasties are worth the trip to Padstow, regardless of which bit of Cornwall you are holidaying in. Crisp, yet buttery pastry, not too crumbly, not soggy. Even the thick crusty bit was edible, not to thrown to the birds like some Cornish pasty crusts. Loaded with fresh filling and hot. Again, not soggy or  dry-moist and flavoursome. Minor complaint, meat to potato ratio was a little under par but other than that, spot on. We got served quickly even though Padstow was heaving and there were folks in the shop. Reasonable price for such a huge pasty.

My pastie was fine, nothing to write home about and not a patch on the one I'd had in Newquay earlier in the week, but fine. My Mrs on the other hand had a mixed veg version and found a piece of metal in hers which cut her gum - ok, she wasn't about to bleed to death but not what you expect. On taking the pastie back to the shop, the assistant said ""oh yes, that would be off a tin"" (so, all this guff about ""only the finest fresh ingredients""...). The really annoying thing was that at no point did my wife receive anything that sounded like an apology and only when she asked for it was she offered her money back.

The Chough Bakery,4.5,Toffee1977,Shropshire,5,The BEST Padstow Pastie!,"I must admit Im not the biggest Pastie or Pie man, but when in Rome you must do as the Romans do.
In Padstow alone there are four Cornish Pastie shops, plus many many others selling pasties, so the choice is plentiful! because of the three excellent ratings on here I opted for the Chough Bakery where there goods are made and baked on site rather than delivered.
The choice is limited but that to me is where the strength lies, this is a cornish shop selling traditional pasties so the words breakfast, thai, chilli, and bannana and chocolate pasties are no where to be seen un like in the other less traditional bakeries Padstow has to offer.
My pastie itself was divine beautifulyl light pastry filled with wonderful steak and vegetables seasoned to perfection, a real pleasure to eat. 
On a final note I also had a wonderful piece (sorry 2) of the fabulous chocolate caramel shortcake without doubt the best I have eaten !

Bakery On The Water,4.5,MikeyG53,Emersons Green,5,"Satisfying sandwich snack, super service","Bourton-on-the-Water is a very attractive popular tourist-town in the central Cotswolds.  The river Windrush, complete with lovely low bridges, runs right-through the main commercial centre.  As you would expect there are many eateries here, offering snacks and meals, so the competition for tourist £££’s is/was bound to be fierce.  There are many eateries offering afternoon or cream teas.  After looking at several; with quaint décor, and (most probably) waitresses in lacy pinafore dresses; I doubted that these would provide a satisfactory quality snack for our outlay.

I was very aware that my Partner was getting weary of looking at prospective places, to find the one that offered good, and fairly-priced wholesome food.  My yardstick was simple: were other customer going there, and did it feel like a tourist-trap?  Eventually we turned a corner in a back-street, and there it was, this artisan bakery shop café.  The queue wasn’t huge, and the place was bustling and busy.  There seemed to me that there was a mix of locals and tourists sat at the tables.  The food in the glass counter cabinet certainly looked good.  There were plenty of staff and they were all busy.  Yes … this was the place!

We ordered a cheese and ham toastie each, plus a pot of tea for two.  The food counter cabinet had showed (amongst other delights) prepared, but uncooked, toasties; the bread was really thick, and the filling looked plentiful.  My expectation was that the toasties were going to provide that good quality snack.

Seating was an issue, but a very pleasant switched-on young lady behind the counter advised us to retreat to a (we felt dull) anteroom where there were unoccupied tables.  We would then be advised, if and when, a table in the main, very atmospheric, dining area became free.  That worked for us, but before we were notified about a free table, we saw a party leave, so we grabbed their table before it was re-taken.

We sat down, but the table was covered with used crockery and cutlery; so we cleared this to one side of the four-seater table, where it was promptly taken away.  Our tea soon arrived and we let it steep, as we do prefer strong tea.  Our plates of food arrived after a few minutes and the toastied did look good.  The very chunky bread was lightly toasted and packed with the ham and melted cheese filling.  The plate was completed with a small leafy salad and some crisps.  This was good tasty rustic food and thoroughly great to eat, and not at all expensive at a total of £25.52 - really great value for a snack that satisfied.

Service was really friendly and efficient, as befitting a family business.  As I left I saw the young woman who served us and gave her the thumb’s up for what was an excellent quality snack with memorably attentive service.  We’ll be back.",23/03/2024

The sourdough was excellent and the Victoria sponge a real treat (and we're quite fussy!).

The one lady served the other person, very slowly and the girl who took our order wandered around and eventually started to make what we thought was our coffee. 
We were completely ignored and felt quite awkward to be honest. I have to say it was painful to watch how slow the coffee was made. The girl seemed like it was a first day and the lady seemed to not know we were waiting even though we were right in front of her. She was just messing around and singing. Anyway, 14 minutes later I asked if our coffee was coming as my wife had to be somewhere. I got a sarcastic reply and felt quite insulted. Then finally given my coffee. Looking at other reviews I guess we drew the short straw when it comes to staff as there are lots of happy customers but some very similar to our experience. A Real shame.

Bakery On The Water,4.5,NatChelt,Cheltenham,2,Not worth the money or the wait,"I grew up in Bourton when this was the wonderful Norths Bakery. I haven't been since then as the village tends to cater for tourists not locals these days. But my family still lives in the area so I thought I'd take a chance and call in this morning to grab breakfast for them. 

I ordered three bacon, sausage and egg baps and two Christmas toasties. Despite being the only person waiting (though people came and went with instant orders), I had to wait over twenty minutes for the toasties, which meant the baps were cold by the time I left. Coincidentally, the toasties were also cold as they had been sitting on the kitchen side from even before the baps and, despite someone checking what I was waiting on, only one lady thought to connect the dots and exclaimed ""oh my god these have been sitting out for ages, I'm so sorry."" An acknowledgement which was appreciated.

The cost was £39 (just under £8 per bap) which seems like daylight robbery for what we got, particularly as there wasn't even any egg in the baps.

Safe to say, I'll leave this place to the tourists. ",02/12/2023

£18! I asked the server whether I had been given the correct bill and was assured I had. £5.80 for a pasty and £3.20 for a small sausage roll!

I'd have taken it straight back only that I had driven 20 miles before opening.  I ditched it because the bread was hard and stale, the tomato obviously old, and the ham, which used to be so fresh, and cut off the bone, was wet, and mass produced.  Shocking!

When he was back at his table the staff started rolling their eyes , laughing and one of them held their little finger up and made a gesture with it.

Bakery On The Water,4.5,manchesterianBangkok,Bangkok,3,Nothing to be proud about,"Was really expecting an artisan bakery so expected a decent bread but their sourdough at £3.80 for the small size was unlike any sourdough I have ever tasted! It would be best described as a feather light white loaf so maybe the girl had made a mistake! Another negative was that the assistant was also the cashier and before touching my bread she had been handling a lot of change so I did mention this was bad practice and she did go and quickly wash her hands and got a new loaf for me.
On a grey Monday there was a line.
We also had a Tomatoes basil soup at £6.50 and a Cornish Pastie at £5.80 both disappointing.",06/06/2023

The worst thing was the way the staff look at you and when you start to give your order they look away to start a conversation with colleagues. This happened twice to us, and on one occasion the server apologised realising how rude this had been.

The food came and me and my husband shared both. The corniche pasty was very full and tasty abd the soup and bread were very nice (leek & potato). The drinks did take quite a while to come We was already half way though out food.

I complained about the gups only to be told they had been very busy and had not caught up with the washing up. We drank our tea barley getting 1 cup each, we ate 1 scoon each and took the oter 2 home.

I then went back up to queue for another pot of tea and when I went to pay with £5 cash, I was told they did not accept Scottish money as it may be counterfeit!!! I was totally humiliated, and if I was going to launder money I don’t think I would be doing it with a £5! Absolutely disgusting way to treat people, I checked in other shops I went to today and they were more than happy to accept cash!

Bakery On The Water,4.5,DipaP,London,2,"Fantastic food, subpar service","This bakery would have achieved a 5 star review if solely based on the food but unfortunately greatly let down by the service.  
The good - we ordered several toasted sandwiches, cream tea, baguettes etc. and all were delicious.  Wish we had this as a takeway to avoid what was to come. The location was good, facilities clean and has more seating at the back.
The bad - service started out ok, staff were polite.  We had 4 children with us under the age of 5, including a 1 year old, who was throwing food on the floor around our table.  I understand this is frustrating but one of the servers then has the audacity to come over with a broom and dustpan and brush and ask us to clean it up as apparently they had lost several customers because of this mess.  This mess was literally under our table and not elsewhere in the cafe, which makes no sense as to why they would lose customers when there were plenty of tables in the back garden.  I cleaned it up but never have I been more insulted, especially after we bought over £60 worth of food and drink.  
My advice, don't bother sitting here if you have young children or staff should put a notice that young children are not welcome.  Have a takeaway instead.",08/06/2022

Bakery On The Water,4.5,vwone,Sittingbourne,2,How Much!!!!,"This place looked very popular and we queued for some time to be served. The food on offer looks great and to be fair it was very tasty. The issue came when I went back in to buy my son a cheese straw we forgot from the first order. I have emailed the bakery the below which explains the situation and sadly they have not responded. I only wanted confirmation that I was correctly charged £4.20 for a cheese straw.

""We visited Bourton on Water last week and stopped by your bakery to pick up some lunch to enjoy sitting by the river. Firstly I would like to say we thoroughly enjoyed all the produce and it was very tasty. I forgot to order my son a cheese straw so I went back in to get one and at the same time thought I would have one myself as they are my favourite savoury snack. I asked for 2 and the girl said £8.40, I said sorry I only want two she advised me there are £4.20 each. She did apologise and remark how expensive they are.  In comparison to the sausage roll that I recall was £2.20 and a loaf of bread for £2 there seems little justification. As I had waited about 15 mins I purchased one for my son in the hope that at £4.20 it would be the best cheese straw he had ever eaten. Sadly this was not the case and the .90p one he had from Penganis in Cornwall was far superior he told me. I was obviously devastated but managed to not let it affect the rest of my holiday.Since returning I have had time to reflect and I just want to confirm that the price was correct at £4.20 because having researched this it just seems incredible. I have found that Cheddar Gorge Cheese company can send me a box for £4.25 that won the great taste award in 2021.""",25/05/2022

Bakery On The Water,4.5,Roberts69,Northampton,3,Despite my high expectations I returned a verdict of just 'Average'.,"Visited Bouton-on-the-Water on Saturday and it was a warm day and thus very busy.  I had already read great things about the 'Bakery' and so we headed here for an early lunch (by early I mean 11:45am).  When we got inside there was not a great deal of choice (the only filled rolls were tuna and cucumber) and service was quite slow.  I had a slice of the Fresh Cream Victoria Sandwich and to be honest the cream tasted like it was on the turn and the cake seemed a tad dry and somewhat stale, (not light, moist and fluffy).  We had take-away and to be honest if we'd been eating in I would have returned it for a refund.  The coffee I had was good though.  So all in all I was sadly disappointed and I wouldn't visit again in a hurry, opting instead to try one of the many other cafe's in Bourton-on-the -Water next time.",16/05/2022

Coffee was poor & bacon rolls not fresh. Would not return.",31/12/2021

We agreed and placed order for coffee and pastries which were brought out to us. The greenhouse was clean and warm enough room for 6 people. Very COVID safe. Pastry was very tasty as well as coffee.

We left. This may be how you do things however there are polite, welcoming ways of conveying that message which would not make your customers feel uncomfortable and awkward.

The pasties were tasty but cold , much prefer them served warm. The cakes were delicious , our choice were fresh cream Victoria sponge and almond petal cake. 
The coffee was very good too . 
Quite expensive though , the above for take out was just shy of £20 but do think anywhere in Cotswolds is dear.

Bakery On The Water,4.5,JKD,Somerset,4,Beautiful charming bakery cafe,"Lovely cafe, filled with charms.

Sat in the backyard, we changed table 3times due to the wasps. I see wasp catchers that are so close to the tables hence why so many wasps. Wasp catchers needs to be hung away  - preferably outside the courtyard boundary…. Makes sense to keep wasps away. 

No toilet sign to be seen so couldn’t use the loo. Thought it was up the steps but staff only. Couldn’t go back indoors - had ‘no entry’ sign. 

Best scones!",22/09/2021
Bakery On The Water,4.5,AlexTheJock,Wigston,3,"Slow, lethargic service","My wife, I and two friends originally wanted to sit out in the garden to have tea and cake, but after seeing the difference in price for eat in and take out we decided to order to take away and eat on the grass beside the river. The queue was not particularly long, but it took an inordinate amount of time for us to get to the front of it. This situation came about due to the very slow staff none of whom seemed to have any oomph about them - one of whom spent more time on her mobile than serving customers. We were actually going to give in and go somewhere else, but everywhere we passed had queues, but I'm guessing none were as slow as this establishment. Even when we got served it took quite a time to get our drinks, and even then one of them was incorrect. Not a place I would use again when visiting Bourton.",19/09/2021

Bakery On The Water,4.5,ByrneC,,4,Nice Cream Tea,"We visited in August 2021. There was quite a large queue to order, which took around 20 minutes. Once we ordered, staff were friendly and polite. We sat in the outside garden, having ordered two cream teas. The scones were lovely, and we were given a good portion of clotted cream and jam. Unfortunately we were very quickly surrounded by a lot of wasps which, although there is not much the bakery can do about this, did spoil the experience. The gardens themselves are really pretty, situated near the Motor Museum. Would definitely return.",30/08/2021
Bakery On The Water,4.5,Helen P,Liverpool,2,Very disappointing experience.,"We visited this cafe quite early on a Thursday morning having eaten here before about 3 years ago and I remembered it as a really nice place. I have to say that this time, we were really disappointed with both the food and customer service. 

We were 4 adults and a baby in a buggy so we opted to sit outside to prevent causing an obstruction inside with the buggy. I was called back when I started to walk through to get a table and told in no uncertain terms that I had to order before sitting! I explained that I wanted to make sure there would be enough room and left my daughter to order. She was then asked what table number she was at……!! I am puzzled to know how we could provide a table number if we have to order BEFORE getting a table??

Once we were finally seated, the food came quite quickly but the egg was overcooked and bacon greasy.

So reading the other reviews it look as though we were unlucky. I suppose everyone has a bad day but we won’t be back.",28/08/2021

However, at 08:30 in the morning, ran out of salmon so couldn't have this and scrambled eggs. So opted for bacon and egg roll, extra bacon, bacon roll tea and cappuccino. But no Gluten free option. What we did get was reheated bacon, dry overcooked and a cold egg. All for the princely sum of just under £20!! If we had taken the time to walk further on, we could have had a full English breakfast with tea between £6.95 and £8.95. Folks work it out, this was expensive in anyone's book.

All 6 of us had a cream tea and at £6 each seemed quite reasonable. The staff even gave us a takeaway box to transport one of the cream teas away with us as unfortunately a party member was not feeling well.  He gobbled down the scones eagerly once we had left and he was feeling better! They also brought us water and there felt like no hurry to rush out whilst we lingered to allow time for our poorly family member to try and shake his migraine. 

We were sat in one of the back courtyard greenhouses which felt very cosy and kept off the odd spot of rain. Beautiful river rushing through next to some of the tables too and away from the crowds of Bourton for a little bit. Perfect.",02/06/2021

However, we managed to grab a shaded table in the little garden and had plenty of options to choose from - I opted for the On Toast which that day had goats cheese, pesto and tomato on and was absolutely delicious.

Staff knew there were 8 of us seated in the garden about to order cream teas. However, we wanted to wait for the last person to join us before ordering (she had to find a place to change her daughter’s nappy).

Upon her return we went to order - only to find out that there were only four scones left (at 4pm). No staff member could take the initiative to ask us to order as they were running low on stock, or keep some back for us. 

The cream teas that came were average, the tea in the pots was not very hot and the waitress was more agitated and interested in telling us to stop a 4-year-old eat some outside chips than in catering for the £65 order we had placed for the adults seated.

Tried to pay using a Scottish banknote but assistant told me they wouldn’t accept Scottish notes of any denomination. Luckily my husband had some English notes.

Heerlijke sandwiches, quiches en helemaal top zijn de scones met clopped cream and jam. Dat weten ze onderhand in China en Japan ook dus er zijn vaak rijen dik aan het wachten buiten. Ondanks de drukte soms blijft de bediening hartstikke aardig. Dikke pluim!

Everything in the bakery looked lovely. We ordered 4 cream teas and asked to change one tea to coffee and was told in a very “fed up” tone the coffee would cost more. That was the start of what I would call very poor service. The only pleasant member of staff was the girl that bought out our food. My friend went in to ask for some butter, was told he would have to pay for it and as he agreed the girl just ignored him and walked off. I know they were busy but that was no excuse for their poor service. I will add the scones were lovely and fresh.",16/09/2019

Bakery On The Water,4.5,JulieBrew,Rochdale,4,Tasty food - very busy,"The bakery is tucked away just off the main street and is worth hunting for.  We had to queue outside although it was lunch time!

The cheese and onion pasty and sausage roll, warmed for us to take away, were very tasty.  We wanted a ham salad sandwich but they were too busy to make one for us so just had one from the pre made ones available.  It was lovely and the bread delicious.

The eclair was so light and the chocolate topping really tasty.

There is seating both inside and outside on site, which again was very busy.  Seating outside next to the river is also available and several families were having a picnic on the river bank, complete with rug and picnic basket!  The bakery would be an ideal place from which to buy the picnic.

Staff were friendly and helpful.  Prices what one would expect.

Gluten free food is also available. 

Would definitely recommend and call again.",02/09/2019

Because we had just eaten lunch elsewhere, we didn't take part in any of the baked goods, but the smells alone were delicious enough! I think it had to be the Cornish pasties they were baking that smelled so delicious. Wish I wasn't so full to have tried one. 

If you are one to prefer the outdoor seating, be wary of their wonderful little wasp forecast, noted both at the till and on the menu board. The day we visited was ""severe to lethal"" so we happily stayed inside.",29/08/2019

Coffees where nice and the lardy cake but how they can get away with serving a bap with 2 very thin sausages cut in half I don’t know, the sausages were the width of a mans little finger , I know you pay more in these places but the profit margin they must make on a sausage bap is extreme, please use some nice thick sausages at least, not take the micky",26/08/2019

Cornish pasties were really good and the cream teas were delicious - the best that we tasted while on holiday. Only very minor point would be that with 2 full size scones with every cream tea, you need more jam and cream. Thought it was very reasonably priced for what we had and I felt it was value for money. I would definitely recommend going in. The place had a really good feel to it and seemed very clean.",19/08/2019

The food was lovely: from the sausage rolls, sandwiches and soup to the freshly baked scones with clotted cream and jam. And all for a reasonable price! The only downside to this place is the wait for tables - there is no organised control or management of tables. We waited approx 30 mins for a table for 5 as this cafe only sits about 25 people. We had to stay standing near the counter and it was very crowded. A better reservation list would work well. We were also really swarmed with wasps! So beware. ",13/08/2019

Didn’t eat lunch as the sandwich options were limited and not to our liking.
They also had a lot of wasps in the garden and it was too hot to eat inside.

They were turning away visitors requesting cream tea, as they had no scones - yet there were scones on display in the window #confused!

Did return, later, for a takeaway blueberry sponge cake and a white loaf which were delicious.

Bakery On The Water,4.5,FarAwayFromHome,Maidenhead,3,Sadly disappointed ,This was a return visit following our visit here last year; sadly on this occasion we felt let down. We ordered a delicious pasty & decided to pay quite a bit more for the addition of salad; i was astounded to see that it was just a little bit of salad garnish. And the young lady who served was very rude - from taking the order through to eventually getting it to our table (there seemed to be confusion of what we had ordered & we were even accused of changing tables). And the extra plate we were told would arrive “in a moment” had to be collected by myself resulting a scowl by the same young lady who found a wet plate & dried it on her food stained apron. Cannot fault the food - delicious. ,18/07/2019

Bakery On The Water,4.5,David L,London,5,It's The Real Thing,"English bakeries don't get any better than this. Its not just the quality of the food but also of the staff and the care of generations of bakers, Clare, leavened with a converted farmer, Graham, turned enthusiastic baker.

Warm like their scones, friendly like their staff and helpful with recommendations of places to eat dinner, Clare and Graham are the real thing, genuine nice people.

And if you want to add to the fun, ask the staff which you should put first on your scones, the jam or the clotted cream.  ""Jam, no cream.  Cream, no jam,"" say different members of the staff.

""We nearly had a fight at a table here a few days ago as the debate  raged over the  jam or cream question,"" Graham told me, with a big smile.

There is a little bubbling stream out back next to the patio. You order at the counter, they give you a wooden spoon with a number on it, and you stick the spoon in a little hole in the center of the table so they know where to bring you your goodies. Everything was delicious! Quite busy when we arrived but we were able to find a table in the front area. There is also a little back seating area (not quite as charming), and we discovered upon leaving, much to our chagrin, that there is a beautiful patio out back. Great place. ",21/06/2019

One of the employees went in search of cream which took a few minutes and I thought this a bit strange given it is a bakery making all sorts of delicious treats. Sadly, we didn't avail ourselves of any of their lovely, yummy looking pastries but all looked delicious. A charming place with a very clean washroom and a lovely setting by the water.",18/06/2019

The cream teas though......really average, geared towards the hoards of tourists that I presume they don't think would know the difference.  Especially disappointing The scones were stone cold and doughy, the clotted cream did not seem at all fresh, and the jam came in the single portion mini jars.

Burns the Bread,4.5,Nicola R,,1,STALE BREAD,"Some people have a 'thing' about wine, others about cheese, others about bread. I'm in the third group. A few years ago, I bought a loaf from Burns the Bread in the High Street in Glastonbury. It was, to say the least, beyond perfect. I was there, again, this Monday, so I treated myself to an 800g granary tin that cost £2.80 (yes, that's right; I had HIGH expectations for that price, as I could purchase the same at Asda for £1.30). 

To say I was almost in tears when I came to eat is it an understatement. The 'crust' was wrinkly soft and the entirety too firm, tell-tale signs of an old or stale loaf. Having cut off ALL 6 crusts, I came to something that would be deemed barely passable after two days given a bog-standard loaf. This 'Burns' loaf had NOT, I repeat NOT, been baked the same day and was being sold from the previous day's leftovers. I can tell, I just can, because I have to have real, fresh bread.

The only positive is that I took a closer look at the Special Bread section in Asda today. I bought a 400g fancy kalamata olive loaf (£1.95). It was gorgeous and HAD been baked there that day. Needless to say, I'll be going through the rest of that Special Bread section.

Burns the Bread in Glastonbury is now a farce. AVOID at all costs.",10/08/2023

They are cooked fresh every day, so you know the products are at there best. It is not always evident exactly which products are vegan (although the aforementioned are labelled as so), so it is always worth asking the staff or requesting to look at their allergen book which lists the ingredients for every product they sell.  

This is a well established local company, and while the products are not as cheap as some of the ""chains"", the quality is very good.",22/07/2019

We bought a number of 'steak slices', the quality of all slices was dismal. Mainly very fatty puff pastry, hardly any filling. What filling there was was thick mushy, but tasty, gravy, a hint of mince and literally only one (or, in one of them two,) tiny pieces of meat per slice.

Burns the Bread,4.5,kmhansing,Halifax,5,Burns The Bread: the poet of bakers,"The staff were wearing straw boaters with a black ribbon. I saw this also in the food hall at Harrods, but subsequent Googling leaves me still unsure if it is a British tradition or what. I liked it though.

The staff were friendly and attentive, but also patient and willing to talk about the products. A bakery is where I would recommend people go when they want a quick bite in the UK; they had all sorts of savoury pies and rolls and butties and pasties and all those things, and they were all amazing. They also have delicious loaves of bread, that they will slice for you while you wait, and all so reasonably priced.

I made quite a few ""dad jokes"" and puns about Burns The Bread's store name, but my favourite is the most accurate: ""Burns the Bread is the poet of bakeries.""",25/03/2019

We had a veggie sausage roll which had to be microwaved, and Cornish pasty (called a Glastonbury pasty) which was warm.

Pastry excellent on both. Fillings not great, but OK. Pasty filling tasty but too mushy. Veggie sausage nicely herbed, but not enough of it.

Eccles cake and choc chip muffin were both delicious.

Quay Bakery,5,kate c,Reading,5,The best of Cornwall in a Crust,"We can only echo the glowing reviews. You can taste the quality in every mouthful. My husband loves Cornish pasties, but so many these days are disappointing. Those at the Quay are exceptional. No searching for steak with a microscope, unlike so many others. Lovely chunks of quality local ingredients in both varieties of pasty, encased in delicious buttery pastry. They clearly stick to what they are best at and only sell top products, which they obviously love when you talk to them about what they make.  We tried one of each and then had to go back after an hour or so to get more to take home! Such a treat.  We're sad that we can't get some delivered, but possibly just as well for our waistlines.

Our experience is that when you arrive early to a bakery you are able to purchase what what fresh baked that day. I was given items that were left over from the previous day, when I asked for the fresh ones I was told that that is not how it is done, that everything isn't made fresh daily and that I had to take the one she was giving me. In the end, the items that we purchased were above average. I had simply hoped for items that were fresh baked.",10/06/2023

I managed only half of mine (they are large!), and saved the other half until we were sat outside The Lugger in Polruan with an earned pint. Lots of mat and veg, and very tasty.

On another day we bought fruit scones for a cream tea, we found the scones to be a good size and light, not at all dense which you sometimes find.

The cinnamon bun was moist and mouth-watering.  The carrot cake was rich, sticky and the icing creamy.  The pasty did have hard edges but who eats that anyway, it's the centre full of chunky veg and large pieces of meat which was juicy that I enjoyed.  I cannot tell you which my lurcher liked as he didn't turn his nose up at any of them.  If I wanted a reason to return to Fowey this bakery would be the reason.",12/09/2021

Quay Bakery,5,Bobby Powell,,2,"Fantastic Food, severely let down by lack of COVID-19 protection","I always get a pasty from this bakery whenever I'm in the area and it was phenomenal! There really is nothing like a genuine cornish pasty. I was served on this occasion by a polite and nice young man (I didn't get a receipt so I didn't get the name) who was more than happy and helpful when answering questions we had about the town, on a different visit I was served by a nice young lady by the name of Daisy (as it says on the receipt), and on a visit in March was served by another warm staff member by the name of Hannah. I could not fault these members of staff as they were polite and friendly. However, really unfortunately this bakery is severely let down by it's COVID-19 protection. Only the young man who served me was wearing a face mask, even after it was made compulsory to wear a mask in shops. Within the shop there was little to no care for virus protection, there was a social distancing square for the shopper to stand on (that wasn't enforced by staff) and a hand sanitiser dispenser that was empty. On a previous visit I was told by a friendly member of staff that she believed that wearing masks was ineffective and that the coronavirus was a myth, which I think was the mentality when re opening this bakery. Fantastic food, but this bakery needs to realise that a pandemic is currently happening and protect their customers.",25/07/2020
Quay Bakery,5,lgd23,Runcorn,2,Very Poor Pasty,"Sorry but must have been unlucky today. When we cooked the Pasty there was virtually no meat in it. Incredibly disappointed having seen the reviews. If I was staying in Fowey I would have gone back to complain.

Quay Bakery,5,Matt B,,5,OMFG!!,"Pipped to the last few traditional cornish pasties by the visiting Royal Navy, so forced to take a couple of Cheese ones..... all I can say is Thank You Royal Navy.... 🤤

AM.... AZ.... ING!

So much so that without tasting the traditional, I happily put in an order for 20 to bring back home, along with 8 Cornish Gouda... only stopped ordering more due to the size of the pasties and limited car and freezer space back at home.

Other highlights include the bread pudding, bakewell tart and scones.

A must visit if you're in Fowey.

Caveat, these pasties are hand made, so a little rustic in appearance and if you don't like chunky filling, go for the mass produced, wafer thin sliced content of other establishments.... and leave these pasties for those who appreciate heartily filled and lovingly crafted fare.

Takeaway only, which is the perfect excuse to go find a place to sit and enjoy the surroundings your in. 
A light, buttery pastry with good size chunks of meat and veg inside. Did I mention, the pasties are huge, very good value.

The bread is perfect, it melts in the mouth, I also bought a couple of their overnight bread rolls which were so light but with real flavour.  I suppose that as with many it is their pasties for which they are best known.  I had the Cornish Gouda and onion, which was huge and packed full of tasty veg, it served as my main meal of the day.  I was staying opposite and as soon as I saw them appear in the window I crossed the road to buy one.  It was wonderfully hot and still was as I got towards the end.  Helpfully they put a notice up to tell you when the pasties will be out of the oven.  Oh as a treat before coming home I bought a piece of their bread pudding and I suppose that it goes without saying that it was the best bread pudding I have ever had, no skimping on the fruit with this, wonderfully moist and flavoursome.

We had Cornish Gouda and red onion pasty and it was absolutely delicious; the cheese was tangy, the onions generous and the pastry thin and crumbly.

As it came up on Trip Advisor with great reviews we thought it would be the place to go and worth the drive.. Got there at 2pm and only one steak pasty left in the shop, disappointing for a family of 5, more annoying was a minimum £5 spend to use a card.. Pasty was ok when warmed up, not the best, personally not a fan of large chunks of meat and veg, I prefer the fillings small diced, but it was not offensive and tasty enough.. Customer service was very good, just a shame there wasn’t any food.. Very tight streets for a large car, parking just opposite but plenty had parking tickets so be aware... ",24/02/2018

Rosemary focaccia, light, golden bread with crunchy salt crystals on top. As you bite into it, you get small bursts of olive oil flavour melting in your mouth. The pungent fragrance of fresh rosemary. Without a doubt the best I've ever tasted. 

Sourdough loaf. A beautiful big patterned loaf with a thick chewy crust. Really good flavoured bread with a very distinctive and delicious 'sour' aftertaste. Truly fantastic!

Billionaires shortbread. Light and crumbly shortbread with a thick layer of soft flowing caramel and crunchy good quality chocolate on top. Lovely big squares of the stuff. Too delicious to adequately describe.

The muffins are to die for! - lovely, light, moist texture & with a warm afterglow from the ginger.  

The bread is delicious, but the Rosemary & Walnut is very special & has to be tasted to be believed.  We had at least three main dinners of Quay Bakery bread with cheese, cold meats & olives.  The rest was savoured either simply with butter or jam.

The Bakehouse,5,David G,,1,Archaic attitude towards individuals with disabilities.,"It surprises me that in 2021 disability discrimination is still a thing, however the young lady serving today wasn't shy when it came to displaying some of the most archaic and ignorant behaviour I've witnessed in a long time.

To cut a long story short I suffer with a severe respiratory disease which I recently underwent surgery for, this makes what should be a simple task like breathing not so easy and hence I am legally exempt from wearing a mask. To tell someone you have a disability is one thing, but to then be humiliated and treated like a liar is an absolute disgrace and you should be ashamed as a business. (Not all disabilities are visible)

Perhaps the staff, or the rude woman today specifically would benefit from some enhanced learning on communication and customer service, not to mention the equality act 2010..

The traditional range of bread is faultless, get there early though as the bread is so good it sells fast!

Their range of cakes are hands down one of the best ranges I have seen for many years, in fact they were so good we brought some home for the next few days. The Belgium buns are amazing as are the huge custard slices, we have hot cross buns, an iced finger and gingerbread man yet to try but I have no doubt they will be amazing!

We actually visited the shop 3 times in one day, for breakfast (cake), some things to take home and then came back for lunch. The cheese and bacon turnovers are the best we have ever had and the cheese and onion slices are amazing.

The Bakehouse,5,SeeGrandadYeah,High Wycombe,5,Simply the finest bakery we’ve used,"This says it all!  The quality and taste of bread, baguettes, buns and cakes is something other bakeries simply don’t produce. Highly recommended is their meal deal. Tesco, Boots, et al meal deals just can’t compete on freshness and yummyness. Outstanding!  And the staff are so friendly!  What’s not to like....!",20/11/2019
The Bakehouse,5,Alan G,Peterborough,5,Best bakery ever!!,"I have been coming to this bakery for many years, and i mean many!

It has the best bread that i have had from any bakery in my life. Our holidays here at the New Forest and one of the most things we look forward too is coming to this bakery.

We buy their sandwich loaves and milk loaves, and fresh sandiches (they are to die for), and the baguettes. The meal deals are great.

Not a lover of the cakes as they may suit lots of people who like huge fresh cream cakes, but i like mine a normal size, so unfortunatley i miss out on those, but we love the choc muffins, last time we had them they were still warm yummmm, and the gingerbread men. They just don't make enough of them.

A very busy bakery, but lots of staff to cope. I'd rather them be busy and not close down as they've not made enough money.",17/11/2019

It was well after lunch and there wasn't much left but what was there looked amazing. Even though I really wanted one of the gorgeous looking eclairs (but didn't want to get cream all down me!) we both decided to have one of their filled doughnuts. I had the apple and my husband had the custard and they were probably the best doughnuts we have ever had! So fresh and so full and the flavours were to die for.
Fantastic and friendly staff, and such reasonable prices a proper asset to the village.",13/05/2019

Every time my teenage caves hit and my body ask for a treat, I go to The Bakehouse which is only a couple minutes away from college and ask for a custard doughnut and no joke man, it makes me bust a nut <3 I don’t know how they’ve managed to make a crunchy yet soft doughnut with just the perfect amount of custard filling and covered in fine sweet sugar crystals. How can I get such perfect doughnut for only 90p!!!
It astonishes me honeslty in addition to this.... the people working there Ong how are they soo nice :)))

The Bakehouse,5,Bryan P,Rugby,5,Lunchtime snack,"While visiting Brockenhurst we came across the bakehouse, & thought that the bagettes & cakes in the window looked nice & as we wanted something for lunch we went in. We had a warm welcome & one of the baguettes had to be made but wasn't a problem then I noticed some of the biggest donuts around 6"" dia so we had to have a couple of those for afters, the shop assistant then asked what drinks we wanted for the meal deal so we had 2 cans of coke. So 2 rolls, donuts & cans came to £5.80 which was very good considering the bagettes were around 10"" long, I was expecting to pay much more.
The proof however is in the eating & it all was very fresh with plenty of filling tuna mayonnaise in the bagettes & jam in the donuts.
I would highly recommend the bakehouse for a lunch time bite to eat to take on a picnic in one of the many places in the new forest. ",28/02/2019

Expect a long queue (but a short wait) as everyone seems to know that it's the best place for miles around.  Lots of locals and tradesmen were queuing as well as the tourists.  
Thoroughly recommend the lunch meal deal - under £3 for a well-filled baguette, a drink and one of the smaller desserts.  
Lots of variety in the baguette fillings, if they haven't got the one you want they'll immediately make it up for you...  
Very well staffed and stocked, with a lot of tempting desserts and cream cakes.  Thoroughly recommended!",07/08/2018

They have an amazing lunch deal of huge baguette, cake and a drink for under £3 definitely not worth making a picnic/packed lunch for exploring at this price. They were huge and didn't skimp on fillings. Meat from butcher across the road and free range! The breakfast and sausage rolls looked amazing but I am the only vegetarian in my family.

I went in one day at 13:45, there were no baguettes or rolls out on display, which would discourage anyone from even inquiring if they had any left. I asked for a chicken baguette and I was told that they had no chicken. What is the point in being a bakery that's open until 5pm but runs out of food around 2pm and closes the kitchen around 3pm?

The custard slices have plenty of custard, the eclairs are about a foot long and the Belgian buns are the softest and most delicious I've ever tasted. I don't actually really like doughnuts but these are beautifully soft and stay fresh even till the next day. Apple turnovers are one of my favourites with plenty of proper apple filling. Lardy cakes are beautifully moist with plenty of fruit. We've also had the hog roast which was really lovely.

It was a cold day, the staff switched on the heaters but they weren't sufficient; we froze. All the menu items sounded appealing, but the eggs Benedict I chose was disappointing - toast too hard (I left the crusts), ham of good quality but too much of it in relation to the two small poached eggs.

Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Leila B,,5,The best lunch in Lyme!,"Myself and my boyfriend had the most wonderful visit to Town Mill Bakery on bank holiday Friday. We’ve visited the bakery several times - it is our go to spot when in Lyme Regis and often make the journey to Lyme just to visit the bakery! 

We arrived to the restaurant on a particularly busy Friday bank holiday and we were seated within seconds of arriving by very friendly staff. We were given the choice to sit inside or outside, and we chose to sit outside as it was particularly sunny day and the outside seating area is very cosy and comfortable. 

Within less than 5 minutes our drinks and food order was taken by a very smiley staff member. We started with two flat white’s with beautiful coffee art, made with delicious local coffee and one Verdent Pale Ale (a south west based brewery). For our lunch my boyfriend ordered a bacon, chicken and cheese toastie with a side of lightly salted crisps, and I ordered the Green Brunch (my favourite) consisting of, homemade brown sourdough, houmous, salad leaves, tender stem broccoli, mange tout, a poached egg and grilled halloumi, stopped with seads. Despite how busy it was, our lunch arrived without less than 10 minutes! 

I couldn’t recommend visiting the bakery enough. The friendly staff, wonderful atmosphere and delicious food cooked by very talented chefs makes Town Mill Bakery not just somewhere you just stop for lunch, but rather a place you plan your trip to Lyme around.  

Thank you staff members of Town Mill Bakery creating such a wonderful brunch/lunch/ afternoon tea experience. We’ll be back soon!",30/03/2024

Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Wabbit99,,3,Both good and disappointing!,"Undoubtedly the bread is delicious here and the overall presentation of the cafe very enticing. However I doubt I would return..
Having read about the amazing Turkish eggs I was keen to give it a try. However when I asked the waitress to expand on what it actually consisted of she could merely tell me it was quite popular and the oil was spicy. The reality was nice poached eggs sinking into a big pile of gloopy yogurt surrounded by a sea of thick bright orange mildly flavoured oil. I had to fish out the eggs and avocado and place on the toast to make the rather bland meal palatable 
Other small annoyances were the ‘wait here’ sign which created a massive queue resting against our seats for most of the meal and what seemed to be an expected tip of 10/15/20 pc added when we got up and queued again to pay.

Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Tma Harding,Lancaster,5,Bathe me in those Turkish eggs,"We decided to visit for lunch based on the reviews. The gentleman who served us was very welcoming and friendly to our daughter, offering her crayons as soon as we took our seat. Every time he came back he asked how she was doing with her drawing.

In the almost 4 years as parents, we've never felt more at ease at a restaurant than we did today. Even though it was a very busy time for them, it was such a nice touch - we didn't feel like we were a burden. 

There's something I've missed from this review - what was it? Oh yeah, the food! We both ordered Turkish eggs and they were mind blowing. Admittedly I've never had eggs that way before, but I'd be very surprised if they tasted *that* good in Turkey. The granary bread that accompanied it was perfect and the drinks were locally sourced and very refreshing. Oh and my girl loved her pancakes. I even took a bite (but didn't want to lose the aftertaste of the eggs), they were delicious too.

Once we were done, we didn't feel rushed or under pressure to pay the bill. It's a popular restaurant on a beautiful day in a busy seaside town - I'd completely understand if they needed the turnover (especially as it was the end of the season), but no, we felt welcome and not at all expendable.

Definitely recommended for anyone and everyone. 

I'll remember those eggs til the day I die.",15/09/2023

Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Digdap,Birmingham,5,What a find!,"Fabulous place tucked behind the seafront. Very popular with a range of ages, and rightly so. Excellent full bodied coffee and great to see a cafe where water is provided alongside the hot drink. Friendly service. Food looked amazing.",19/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,ajh4040,,5,Fantastic lunch spot,"We stumbled across this place looking for a table of 10 for lunch. We were able to get a table and the food was just fantastic. Service was brilliant and all very reasonably priced. A true delight, so much so, we returned 2 days later! ",12/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Catherine H,,4,Nice breakfast and relaxed atmosphere!,"Lovely food, lots of vegetarian options. Bench seating was fine for us but perhaps not great for everyone. Accommodated children well with pushchairs left to the side and providing highchairs. Food was generally very nice, particularly the bread. I was however, disappointed and surprised that they wouldn’t swap the poached egg on the vegetarian brekkie for scrambled (personal preference) even though it was available and the menu said to advise of any dislikes.",05/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,ibisti,Guildford,5,The perfect independent bakery and restaurant,"I was compelled to write a review of one of our favourite places to visit on holiday when in the wonderful Lyme Regis after reading a rather pointed review by another visitor. For a start this is a Bakery, it says so in its name, so don’t be surprised that many items include gluten! There are gluten free options as there are vegetarian but the bread and pastries do take centre stage. 
 The coffee came with beautiful latte art and the food was amazing. I would say that this is one of the best value for money places in Lyme. The portions are generous and the prices are lower than many other places near by. 
 All of the staff were attentive and friendly and more than willing to discuss what was on the menu.
 All I would say is be ready for a wait as they employ a first come first served system with no bookings. It works well and I guess removes the problem of “No shows”.",03/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,James G,Leicester,5,"Assume Food, and the friendliest staff","Never failed to be treated like royalty and fed like a king.

From the smooth rich coffee, to the clearly carefully chose ingredients int he food.

My only complaint is  it to far from home to visit regularly. ",03/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Drew M,Bristol,5,Reliably good,"My partner and I visit Lyme Regis every few weeks and always make a point to come to TMB. The service is great, food and coffee amazing (and good value), and there's always a spot outside so we can sit with our dog. We've visited most cafes in Lyme over the years (and they're all good) but find ourselves coming back to TMB every time.

The service staff are always friendly and attentive. The menu is full of bangers - personal favourites are the Eggs Benedict for brunch, or the Beef Brisket sandwich for lunch.

It's popular with locals and visitors who know about it, but because it's tucked away from the seafront we've never had to wait for a table even during the summer. The outside seating is also a nice shelter on a rainy day, or welcome shade during a heatwave.",03/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Elise J,,5,"Best bakery, must visit!",We visit every year and it's always perfect! Best baked produce we have ever had ( well travelled ). Staff are fantastic and always so helpful. You must visit if going to Lyme Regis! See you soon 😊 ,02/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Nicholas A,,2,"Town Mill Bakery, Lyme Regis","We came here for breakfast. My partner is gluten intolerant and we were slightly surprised by the fact that there was only one gluten-free item on the otherwise extensive menu. This is in contrast to other establishments in Lyme Regis who have multiple gluten-free dishes and/or dishes which can be made gluten free upon request.

We asked if they have any gluten free bread, and were told no.

We asked about what we thought would be a reasonable gluten-free adjustment to their main breakfast, swapping bread for potatoes which are elsewhere on the menu, and was told in quite curt terms that it is not possible to 'pick and choose'. We were told that his was due to the small size of the kitchen, which is open and visible to the restaurant. However we have eaten at other establishments which have smaller kitchens and who have been much more accommodating. 

We were rather taken aback by the unwillingness to compromise to make reasonable adjustments, and so we left without purchasing anything. 

Giving 2 stars (instead of 1) because I am sure the food would have been very good, but we didn't order any! ",01/08/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Astencijo,Basingstoke,5,Amazing brunch,"Amazing place and great food for brunch. It has a lovely atmosphere, you won't get wet even on a rainy day.

The menu is varied and delicious. It was very busy which gave the place a buzzy atmosphere. 
Due to the long tables and benches it’s a great venue for large groups but this shouldn’t put couples / smaller groups off going. 
The waitress we had on this visit was a little abrupt and not very warm / friendly but we enjoyed our lunch and will be back.",11/07/2023

Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Fearless35036329106,,2,Nice food spoilt by rude waitress,"My wife and three young children (including pram) visited this cafe for lunch, we waited for some time outside before we sat down at a table that had become vacant outside in what was a busy lunch period. We were “greeted” by quite possibly the rudest woman we’ve ever been served by. She asked   “who seated you” we replied “no one” she replied “you’re literally sat by a sign that says, ‘wait to be seated’” we apologised and asked if the table was reserved. In all honesty our pram and their plastic beach spades obscured said sign and we just wanted to get out of the way of other customers and staff. We proceeded to order drinks without any time given to look at menus. My partner ordered diet cokes before sarcastically being told “you can have anything you like off the menu, but it has to be on the menu” we studied the menu and proceeded to order what turned out to be rather awful tasting sugar free colas… (Diet Cokes?). What could have been an enjoyable lunch was spoilt by someone who clearly requires a customer services refresher course or perhaps a change of career.",16/05/2023

We stopped for a late lunch, the front of house  guy was lovely and seated us after a brief look at the menu. The food was equally as excellent as the service. Even the kids (6 & 11) are the huge steak pasties they were served.
We went back on Monday for brunch, before hitting the road for the drive home. The full breakfast was delicious and filled us up for the day.  The staff were once again lovely and very attentive.

it’s a cosy little place and clearly the owners feel passionately about it. The guy running the place was delightful.

Town Mill Bakery,4.5,MeJones,,2,Terrible Service,"We were so excited to try town mill after going 10 years ago and reading the recent reviews, but we were severely disappointed. 
We arrived 30 minutes after opening and it had a few people dining but it wasn’t busy. We were seated but then ignored for over 20 minutes. Whilst waiting we  went to look in the bakery at the side to see the delicious baked goods, and they looked no better than supermarket offerings. If anything, it all seemed like it had been sat out for days, as it was dry, shrunken and lacklustre. The photos used online (promo) are not representative of what’s actually available. Due to the way it works, cafe customers go next door to look for baked goods but after being told to go look by cafe staff,  I was then questioned by the staff for pushing in (queue for takeaway) I don’t mind being questioned but it wasn’t in a polite manner and was accusatory in tone. After heading back in to the cafe, we waited a further 15 minutes and still no service. I wouldn’t mind if it had been busy but it was bordering on quiet. It’s also open kitchen and the chefs were simply standing looking like they’d rather be anywhere else creating quite an uncomfortable environment. I’d like to say the food salvaged this place but in the end we left as no one served us and we were sick of waiting. The one thing this place needs is customer service as it’s severely lacking. I also phoned prior and was hung up on by the staff member as I was clearly an inconvenience. A real letdown.",04/01/2023
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Florence,Marlow,5,Outstanding food & service,"We visited this cafe after recommendation from local friends. We were not disappointed.

From the warm and friendly welcome til the moment we left was terrific. We quite often visit Lyme and are kicking ourselves that we hadn’t visited before. Everything I had with my breakfast was outstanding, poached eggs perfect, succulent sausage and proper bacon. The sourdough bread delightful and the beans worth an hour’s drive alone. The ham, eggs and hollandaise sauce was equally impressive, fresh, generous and perfectly cooked. This is undoubtedly our first stop on our next trip.
Outstanding.",09/11/2022
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,David R,Charmouth,5,Simply not like anywhere else in Lyme,We have been visiting for years but went into today a cold wet Saturday morning and again really really enjoyed the experience so much I had to share a review with you. The place was full  the noise generated by all the conversations  filled the air. A really great Vibe. You will either love or hate this place but if you want really quality food and drinks served in a really casual but friendly manner. A great atmosphere and really reasonable prices for the quality make a point of visiting. Only open until 3pm. The ideal time to visit is either brunch or an early dinner. I would say this is the best place in Lyme for either.,05/11/2022
Town Mill Bakery,4.5,v f c,Newcastle,3,Friendly - OK,"Had been huge fan of original owner at Rousdon Cafe so came with hope in heart for similar Big Bang tasty, local fare.  Friendly staff, relaxed but narrow tables, (can’t fit two plates easily opposite each other) - v dog friendly which was lovely though.  Friend had the full breakfast - good sausages but overly spiced black pudding and bland beans, (definitely not cooked slow with molasses for authentic cowboy bean taste sadly).  Sourdough bread lovely and chewy but fried in a bit of light oil so not as tasty as if given a bit of butter love.  No immediate info emphasising sourcing from local farms/producers but I could easily have just missed this and failed to remember to ask the sunny staff.  Light pancakes with maple syrup but oh dear, butter in those little generic foil wrapped pats - definitely not locally sourced!",17/10/2022

Service was brilliant, really friendly and helpful - seemed like nothing was too much trouble and super apologetic when they'd run out of sausage rolls etc. Hardly their fault when we turned up close to closing (3pm).

There's tables and benches both outside and in, suitable for us as a couple, but I also saw larger families and dogs being warmly welcomed.

I can thoroughly recommend the pancakes with maple syrup and fruit - they were amazing. Had we been staying longer I think we would have returned to sample even more off the menu.",20/07/2022

We ordered a bakers breakfast and the brisket sandwich. The bakers breakfast was large and tasty, and came with an extra egg as we had ordered no mushrooms.

Town Mill Bakery,4.5,Wildsnoopster,Sunbury,3,Hit and Miss on this particular day.,"Weird really. Visited on a day they were having wifi problems so no wifi and no card payments but all of that is OK. However it did lead to focusing on sorting out the problem rather than customers. The bins smelt of fish and were located near the outdoor tables, there was a  lack of fruit available on the pancakes and when my wife asked for some toast because they didn't have fruit for the pancakes she was told they don't do toast. It's a bakery and it doesn't do toast. 

That said the croissant and pain aux raisin were excellent as in French quality pastries and the coffee was equally superb. Genuinely even after the lack of products I would go back for the pastries and coffee. However it was all a bit haphazard so only a 3/5 for this visit.",23/06/2022

The sandwich didn't disappoint. I did want to do takeaway like I did last time but was told they only did takeaway food that was from the takeaway section because they were busy (fair enough) & also they couldn't reheat any of it. The only warm/hot food you could takeaway was soup but surely more difficult to takeaway soup than a sandwich! I didn't fancy a cold pasty or soup so I decided to sit outside & I ordered a bacon sandwich which as previous said was amazing!
I couldn't recommend a takeaway from this place unless you want soup or cold pasty but I will be back again to have the bacon sandwich.",24/02/2022

In Bournemouth I would have paid twice as much and it wouldn't have been half as good. My wife had a cake. She swore it was the best cake she had had in years.

Fabulous pies & pasties, freshly prepared filled rolls and an amazing array of breads, cakes & pastries too. Absolutely worth a short queue in the busy holiday season, but do spare a thought and a smile for the staff who work such long hours during the summer heat - can’t be easy working in those temperatures, patiently waiting as we agonise over so many choices of filling, bread type, naughty but nice cakes etc.

Explained my story, and requested to reserve one for the Sunday, received a message late Saturday night saying they’d made them especially for me.
Collected the cakes Sunday, dropped off to the mothering law the same day - and racked up countless brownie points.

Efficient good service from the young man working.  Another member of staff was rather brisk/unfriendly.  Several veggie option savoury pastries and a prawn baguette, 3 drinks and 3 good local crisps £15 - happy with the freshness (but not much filling on the far side of the baguette).

Cheesy vegetable lattice and pasty - delicious!  Reasonable coffee.  Able to sit nearby outside amongst the hustle and bustle by Corfe Castle.

Corfe Castle Village Bakery,4.5,Steve P,Southampton,3,Decent bakery,"This bakery offers a tasty and cheap alternative to the sit down eating places in the village. It is usefully open on a Sunday. There's nothing unusual or particularly special about the bakery, but they do what they do very well. There's a selection of warm savouries as well as filled baps, and the typical selection of British bakery cakes, such as bread pudding and almond macaroons. Everything we had was nice, and the price was good. Service was efficient rather than warm and friendly. All in all an average British bakery, but certainly a welcome shop in the village.",10/10/2016

There is a wonderful selection of bread, pastries and cakes.  They also offer hot and cold drinks to take away.

We bought custard tarts and they were the best we have ever had, so much nicer than the mass produced ones you get in the supermarket.

It is no surprise that people queue out the door to buy their goods.",27/03/2016

It was here I was introduced to my first lardy cake. I am so glad we walked around the castle before visiting this amazing bakery.

Won’t be going back. No manners and gave the impression we were getting in their way while they cleaned glass counter front. Rude to my 16 year old son asking for a chicken pastie.

Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,kayleighT49,Rousay,5,Tasty pasties!,"I have tried Cornish pasties from various establishments over the years, and I think Barnecutt's may do the best I have tried. They are not the cheapest pasties, but a pasty is a great value meal anyway. 

The bakery has a good selection of other baked goods, rolls, etc. - I have tried a few different items and would say overall it is  'okay', but they definitely excel on the steak pasties! 

The premises seem clean, and the staff are friendly. My most recent visit was with Covid protocols still being implemented, so it is one-way entry, with exit out of the back. We were also directed to an outside area to wait for fresh pasties to come out of the oven, after we had paid. 

I would advise arriving early, to avoid queues during the lunchtime rush, as parking is not great outside the bakery, and queue can extend near to a busy road. The pasties will be at the right temperature in 30+ minutes after purchase anyway, if left in the bag.",05/08/2021

Some of us had pasties - steak and Stilton being a favourite. Another had a baguette which was monstrous and great value for money. Someone also had salad which was very expensive for the size and quality.

Unfortunately, the two women working in this bakery were unsmiling and unhelpful from the start.

They made us feel so unwelcome and such an inconvenience that we considered leaving without buying anything but my elderly father was hungry so we quickly made our purchases and left.

Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,Nettienan,Guardamar del Segura,5,Pasty paradise ,Best pastys around and that said by a cornish man - my hubby.  My stepson travels from Padstow to St Merryn for these pastys and a doughnut. Hubby lived the Chelsea buns his favourites. ,16/05/2015
Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,f0xyf0x124,Woodford,5,Love this bakers,"I am not the biggest fan of bread or pastries, but love cakes.  However, whenever I visit this deli I end up with loaves of different breads and even ate a sausage roll this year (bearing in mind I don't even eat meat), this was really tasty.  The cake selection is vast and all that I have tried have been lovely.
They sell out quite early in the day, so get in there early and get some breakfast !

Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,kiranj,Leeds,2,Lovey cakes shame about the staff,"Treats were lovely.

The staff needs serious training in basic customer service, at least lessons in smiling.
One cheeky member of staff bagged up a cake when I only asked what it was - felt obliged to buy it. 

Wouldn't recommend purely on customer service. There's plenty of places which pride in service and I would rather spend my money there.",21/10/2014
Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,Miss-English-Rose81,Nottingham,5,Little gem,This place is amazing. I am a bit of a food snob and loved it here. The food was so fresh and tasty the filled rolls amazing. The cakes were tasty and even the frozen meals. We on our arrival knew we would not get time to shop so brought a large vegetable lasagna it was delicious. My partner is a big meat eater and he loved it so much he insisted i recreate it for him at home. My only niggle is wish it stayed open until 5pm. Lovely place.,01/10/2014
Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,Gritty M,Cochrane,5,Perfect Pasties,"Lots of bakeries and food stops in Cornwall claim to offer the “World’s Best Pasty,” but ignore the hype and ask the Cornish locals. For those who don’t know what the big deal about pasties is, they are a tin miner’s lunch dating back hundreds of years - basically a meat pie in a shortcrust pastry, crimped to seal in all the goodness. But a pie’s a pie, right? Wrong. Perfection in pastry is always a craft that few quite achieve, and the amount and mix of filling ingredients can make or break the best pastry crust. Bernecutt’s pasties have the perfect blend of thin, crispy, flaky crust, with lots of lean steak, potatoes and suedes. My wife and I tried the cheese & onion, and steak & stilton - both were outstanding and worth the trip to Liskeard.",28/09/2014
Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,localharvester,Truro,2,Horrid pasties,"Visited for a pasty (one of the many occasions) being local to the area these are normally the best around here but unfortunately they aren't so good any more to much pepper, cheese pasty doesn't seem the same dunno if they've changed the recipe but I'll be sticking to what I know from now on!!!",21/09/2014

Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,Trailer1967,,5,"Quality bakery, Shame about the staff.","I recently visited this shop, during my 2week stay in st Merryn, 
I went in to the shop almost everyday during my stay trying the pasties, sandwiches, cakes and best of all the amazing deli bar which I have to say is the best thing I have ever eaten choosing from a variety of different dishes in a mixed medium tub. My favourite being the sweet potato and bacon.
All the staff are very welcoming and friendly,  How ever theres one tall skinny girl that I did try and avoid on a few occasion as her customer skills are terrible, she was so impolite and rude it really did shock me the first time she served me, I felt everything I asked for was an effort for her to get for me, even a carrier bag seemed so much hard work for her. She obviously doesn't enjoy her job as much as the other ladies working there. 
If it wasn't for the other happy, jolly members of staff and the quality of the products I don't think I would be reviewing this shop as highly.

Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,Nipsy1,,4,The best Pasties but........,"Probably the best pasties I have ever tasted. Especially love the cheese and onion. 
One word of warning though buy from the deli shop counter and not from the cafe/restaurant. I bought my usual cheese and onion pasty in the cafe but it had been warmed up so long in the MICROWAVE that it was too hot to eat, the pastry had gone soggy in the middle and the ends had gone hard. The pasties are usually warm from the shop son I have no idea why they need to use a microwave. I have no idea what other food is like but my experience wasn't great. My wife had a salad and enjoyed that.",07/06/2013

Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,CornwallFloss,,5,Can't be Beaten,"You honestly cannot beat Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakeries.  He has a branch in Rock too which I haven't seen mentioned by other reviewers. All his shops are clean and bright and the staff are happy, polite and helpful. The standard of the food is excellent and the choice very varied. I think of myself as a bit of an expert on pasties having tried them from all over Cornwall including some ""award winning"" pasties and I genuinely don't think Barnies can be beaten. You never see an advert for Barnecutts, they don't need to advertise as the food does it for them.  Well worth a visit even if you have to make a detour to get to one of his shops.",16/11/2012
Malcolm Barnecutt Deli Bakery,4.5,McCeeBee,,5,Best pasties ever,"Bit late in submitting this review but here goes; as a family we stayed in Wadebridge in the summer and discovered Malcolm Barnecutt's shops and the delights that lay inside. All of the family had a pasty for lunch most days and as a consequence put on a considerable amount of weight. The pasties are brilliant, the choice is wide and during the week I must have tried most varieties of their pasties. Having written this I may go on-line and order a pasty delivery.",03/11/2012
