So delicious as the local suppliers are all A1 quality sellers. Love the lack of plastic packaging too. All is reusable or recycled.

This time I ordered a mixed box with flavours I chose myself, and surprisingly my favourite was the strawberry one with pop tarts on it, it wasn't as overwhelmingly sweet as I thought it was going to be! I really enjoyed it.
My least favourite, which came as a surprise, was the cinnabon one... it was so sweet, that even with my sweet tooth I couldn't manage it. I loved the cinnamonness of it but I couldn't handle the sweetness. I had to leave it. My 2nd or could it be joint favourite with the strawberry? Was the toffee crisp cookie, sweet but I love toffee crisp, I enjoyed that one very much. The Biscoffi one was scoffed very quickly too . Definitely flavours to have again,except sadly for the cinnamon cookie, that's a no im afraid, sadly.

thanks so much for leaving us a review,
we are so glad you like your products and was happy with the packaging

I do feel the 3 star review is a little sad to read :-( especially when you seem to be happy with the products.

we do state on our website when ordering when to expect the delivery giving our customers all the information so they can decide if they are happy to place an order knowing how long delivery will take.

as we are a bakery who bake everything in-house and also we have such high standards with our product quality, making sure our products get to you as fresh as possible means we take your order then we process and arrange the baking schedule so that we can bake and post the order the same day.

we also post every order tracked 24 so that you receive it the day after it was baked meaning that everything is as fresh as we could possibly get it to you.

its so hard as we are often expected to keep up with the huge companies that are sending non food items and we simply couldn't do this whilst making sure our that quality comes first which in our opinion it always should.

I do know some company bake ahead of time so that they can send the items on the same day they was ordered but this means the products are already a day or 2 old before they even get sent to you.

unfortunately cookie have 3-5 days shelf life, so we would rather give the customer all the information on the length of time to expect the order this is no more then 5 working days and not sacrifice the quality you receive.

also the postage cost is actually what we pay to Royal Mail so we don't have very much choice on what we can do here, unless we send on a second class basis but again this affects the quality.

we really have tried to make sure you receive your order in the best condition and to give you a all the information so you would know what to expect.

but thanks so much for choosing to order from us as small business it means a lot and we really value your custom.

also reviews are massive part of us gaining more customers

It’s Trustpilot who automatically send out ‘review emails’ unfortunately, they don’t come directly from us.

We’re sorry your order hasn’t arrived yet but as a small independent business we’re gutted that you’ve give us a 1* even though the delivery timescale is completely out of our hands once Royal Mail have it.

We hope you can edit this review once your order arrives which looks like it will be today

Full disclosure, I met her and her husband a few years ago before I knew about the business, and I have ordered lots of her produce over the years and had excellent feedback from my clients that I sent it out to.

I’ve sent her biscuits out over the years with a thank you message on them, packaged them up with a covering letter to my clients and it’s another way of telling my clients I value them…

Anyway, excellent service, great product and an easy process.

Well done Caroline, onwards and upwards.",Date of experience: 27 September 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,27-Sep-22,Thank you so much for your lovely review Will!,The Kitsch Hen,4.9

If this related to your Christmas pre-order then we can only apologise if the information on our website was not clear & you didn't realise that we wouldn't be shipping Christmas biscuits in November...we always want them to arrive just before a special occasion so that they are as fresh as possible. We upgraded the shipping (at our cost) to a tracked service for many of our Christmas orders & we can see that your order arrived on 16th Dec, in plenty of time before the big day!

If this was another order that has arrived much later than expected, we had no contact from you to let us know of the issue and we would have quickly resolved this for you!

The postal strikes have been on going for many months now & they are sadly causing delays to orders. Delays which are totally out of our control.

Either way, we would always ask that you contact us first before leaving a review, it doesn't seem fair to blame us for something which isn't our fault.

Sending nothing but best wishes & our apologies, The Kitsch Hen Biscuit Team.",The Kitsch Hen,4.9

8 reviews,Joanna Ferraro,GB,24-Jan-22,"Appalling customer service from Caroline, the owner","Sadly, I've had a very poor experience with Caroline, the owner of Kitsch Hen.  Her customer service skills are horrifyingly appalling! She fails to respond to emails and text messages, doesn't answer the phone, and when she does, she lies and makes promises to get back to you when she actually doesn't.  On two occasions now, I have tried to order biscuit cakes from her.  On the first occasion, April last year, she said she couldn't make one for me - and there she took her time responding, leaving me with very little time to sort an alternative.  More recently, the second time, she did the same again, but on this occasion, she sadly lied and was dishonest enough to tell me that she had been busy in a meeting all day.  At which point, as a test, I got my mother to call instead.  Of course, she answered the calls.  I texted her to find out why she was avoiding my calls/messages and why she was lying.     There is history between Caroline and myself.  Back in 2020, she had made me a number of Wedding Invitation biscuits for my wedding.  When I collected the order, at which point I must add, she also failed to deliver on time, I found all of the packaged wedding biscuits to be imperfect.  The gold paint had not been dried enough for them to be damaged/marked by the greaseproof paper, which of course the paint was smeared all over too.  Of course, I expressed my dissatisfaction graciously.  I expected nothing less than what she had promised, a perfect quality product.  These after all, were going out as invites to all of my wedding guests!  Caroline at this point had broken down in distress with tears, going on to explain that it was all due to her ongoing domestic personal issues.So, I did the decent thing, and offered to help her in several ways.  By allowing her to take her time and remake the biscuits, and delaying the delivery date a further one more time.  By offering to help her remake the biscuits, and/or package the biscuits, or simply do anything else for her she felt would help, whilst at the same time continuing to console her by hugging her, wiping away her tears and listening to her problems!  I was patient, understanding, empathetic, sympathetic and helpful.  I am simply dismayed and flabbergasted at such horrendous attitude in return.  Caroline needs to remember how to treat people decently back, as life generally works in mysterious ways!!!  She has certainly forgotten how to reciprocate the kindness and generosity of others.  She has become dishonest, ungrateful and arrogant and does not care about decent and good clients like myself.  People - remember to vote with your feet with such uncaring businesses.  They will be here today and gone tomorrow.  Already, we are starting to see the arrogance in her product/work, boring and very samey.  There are better biscuit makers out there , offering the latest and edgy on-trend biscuits.",Date of experience: 24 January 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03-Feb-22,"Sadly, there are times when a review is more of a personal vendetta which no amount of discussion will change. We know that the words being used to describe Caroline could not be further from the truth & we are fortunate that anyone reading this would realise that.

You have not written this review to warn others, you have written it from a place of negativity. And in all honesty, the fact that you could refer to Caroline’s “ongoing domestic personal issues” as well as write the phase “Caroline needs to remember how to treat people decently back, as life generally works in mysterious ways” in relation to her devastating fertility journey - is the most abhorrent thing we have ever encountered. Your text messages also included that Caroline should remember “karma” and her “difficulties in life” which only cements this further. This along with your review says so much more about you than it ever will about The Kitsch Hen.

The final “insult” of The Kitsch Hen’s products being “boring and very samey” begs the question…if you truly felt that way, why were you so keen to order a biscuit cake?

We truly hope that you find peace in your life as well as a suitable birthday cake for your husband by the end of February.

I bought the ‘choose your own’ box of 6 with one large circle, two smaller circles and three hearts. I wish I’d known the size beforehand though and maybe not ordered. The box they came in was little bigger than A6, so the biscuits all had to fit in there and for £23 I think I’d have shopped elsewhere.

I like the fact that the fruit pies are not over sweet. With a spoonful of clotted cream - delicious.
My only reservation is the packaging my order comes with. The insulated bag and cool pack - could they be returned and reused?
Could an alternative be used for the heavy duty tape used to completely cover the box.
It all keeps the pies in good condition but not great for the environment - all that packaging.

It was worth ordering a little more to qualify for free p&p. I can even re-use the packaging again.
Jennifer even messaged to explain if it was ok to add two extra of another flavour as they thought one of the pies didn’t present properly. It looks perfect to me. How’s that for fabulous quality control!

I opted for the Beef & Blue version as steak and blue cheese anything is a favourite of mine. I didn't notice until I was getting the pie out the fridge for dinner that it was gluten-free; I was a bit cautious as gluten-free pastry can be a bit, well, meh. But no need to worry, the pastry was fantastic, crisp and delicious, making it one of the nicest pies I've eaten and if I'd not seen the box I wouldn't have believed it was gluten-free. It was good value too, I served it with mash and greens and it did two potions.

My husband ordered a mixed selection, mainly for himself, but included a few vegetarian options for me. I was dubious as I'm not generally a fan of pastry, but as soon as i tasted the pastry on these I was sold - it's light, tasty and not a hint of the heaviness or sogginess that usually puts me off. They are all really generously filled too, so you never feel short changed in content.
My particular favourite is the sweet potato, spinach and goat's cheese, but both varieties of mushroom pie were also really tasty. My husband couldnt choose as he said he loves them all equally. The lamb and mint did get a special mention, though.
We havent tried the sweet pies, but a friend has rated them highly too. They are next on our list. The pies are freezer-ready and delivered in a fab little cold box, which meant that even though I was worried that we'd end up having to cook them all on arrival, they were still frozen perfectly.

10 reviews,R J,GB,20-Aug-20,"Easy ordering, quick delivery, excellent pies!","I placed an order and received the pies just a few days later. I had a couple of messages telling me when they would be delivered as well. Awesome packaging!

When my husband saw they were gluten free he started moaning and asking why I had wasted money. We had a beef pie each for lunch today (the rest are in the freezer), they were excellent! He had to admit they didn't taste like they were gluten free lol. Nice proper meat filling, no yucky bits or filler inside, and the pastry was light and perfect too. I served them with home grown veg and gravy made with home grown onions. Definitely looking forward to having another one next week, and will be trying the pulled pork one then too.

You have made a sceptic into a convert, well done! One very pleased customer here. Shame I can't post photos to show how good they look, definitely no skimping on filling!",Date of experience: 20 August 2020,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,02-Sep-20,Truly one of the funniest reviews we have received!

Have ordered previously and thought they were lovely quality and great taste.

However I ordered a Christmas brownie and cookie box and it just didn’t taste as fresh as it previously had and the flavours weren’t as good. Not bad enough that you’d complain or not eat but half did go in the bin as I just wasn’t that tempted to go back for more.

If I saw a really unique flavour or concept I might be tempted to try? But for your ‘standard’ flavours i just didn’t feel the price and quality were aligned. Also not overly keen on some of the content which has felt a bit guilt trippy it manipulative, I’m sure not the intention but I don’t want to feel personally responsible for a business owners happiness and well-being.",Date of experience: 22 December 2023,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,22-Feb-24,"Hi Lucy

I’m glad to hear you have enjoyed your previous orders, but I’m genuinely sorry to read you were disappointed with your recent purchase. We bake everything fresh and price all our products fairly for the quality of ingredients we use. On this occasion, this box may not have been for you, but we take all feedback on board.

I am also sorry you have not been enjoying our content. As you said, it is not our intention to ever manipulate our customers. We pride ourselves on delivering genuinely delicious products for our customers. That has always been our only intention. Anything personal I have shared has purely been to take our customers on our journey with me, through the highs and lows of running a business from start-up, through a challenging economy, and occasionally mentioning the personal journey I have been through too. I am merely human. You are most certainly not responsible for my well-being. I am simply genuinely grateful to every single person who purchases through us and want to shout that from the rooftops!

Overpriced for what you get and that’s even when it was purchased ‘on offer’. The bakes themselves (brownie, cookies) were mediocre at best. Nothing special at all and didn’t taste at all fresh.

Halloween was soooo good and it’s not just “cookies and dips” it’s the experience, the passion and the love that goes into everything they do what makes the best experience and cookies/dips.

I always tell people about them and it’s been a pleasure to see how much dunk cookies have grown.

The fabulous team at dunk have a gift in creating or (re creating) these array of flavours and making it their own.
You know how there is different milk chocolate. That's Dunk Dips.
The banana and custard is a flavour all on its own, and the custard compliments the banana so well that it doesn't have that banana aftertaste, think custard cream meets chocolate with a dash of banana for the secret ingredient. I hear it's being discontinued but I for one put a vote in for banoffee as I can already imagine it tasting as moreish as old school sweets toffo

I love the products, I’ve tried a range of cookies, dips, brownies, blondies, sample boxes, limited edition products. I feel like I’ve sampled a lot. There is definitely something for everyone, I haven’t loved everything but then I wouldn’t expected too. The quality has always been there, the freshness too - even when DPD have been a day late delivering it has still been super fresh. I like the option to freeze things (not all of it freezes but lots does) - especially when you’re buying a lucky dip box as it’s a lot of product to consume in a short time frame.
I personally love the packaging and knowing it’s environmentally as friendly as can be. That really stuck out for me. I like that is is a small business and really believe such businesses should be heavily supported, it is not an easy thing to do; given the currently climate.
I really like the Instagram updates and the team behind the business, their ethos and values are fab and I will definitely be a life long customer.",Date of experience: 31 May 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,,Dunk Cookies Ltd,4.9

They sell the very best cookies I’ve ever ordered - super fresh, always delicious with creative cookie combinations -, and the quality of the dips is out of this world (Dunkstar Martini addict here).

The current delivery system is great - you’re guaranteed a delivery date based on the day of the week you order. The cookies are always so fresh, that it’s never a problem if you’re out and can’t receive your order on the day, or end up getting your parcel from a DPD pick up shop a couple of days later.

1 review,Al,GB,Updated 29 Apr 2022,Spring Fair Themed Box,"First of all can I just say that I've bought a lot of cookies and dips from Dunk Cookies and their products are amazing, but on this occasion I feel extremely disappointed.

Usually their themed boxes are great products and great value for money but their Spring Fair Box, in my opinion, was poor and I feel like I've been taken for a ride!

Considering subscribers got this box for the sale price of £27 not £32 it's the worst box I've ever received.

The new bundle on sale at £25 is better value as it has more products.

Sorry to leave this review but seriously I think you should contact everyone who bought the Spring Fair Box as it certainly wasn't what you said in the description ""the best of dunk"". It's put me off buying themed boxes again but as I said your cookies and dips are lovely it's just a shame about this themed box. Four products for £27 (or usual price £32)! A bag of vanilla cookies with a small plastic tub of dip, cookie fries with a small plastic tub of dip, 2 flat ring doughnuts with white chocolate icing and one small hot dog cake (possibly the size of 2 small angel slice cakes from Mr Kipling).

Even if the dips were the regular size this might have been a bit better. I've put half of my cookies in the freezer for when I buy more dip as the dips were far too small.",Date of experience: 18 April 2022,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,18-Apr-22,"Hello, thank you for your feedback, and we are sorry you didn’t love your themed box this time around.

We always strive to make every experience with Dunk magical. We’ve been trying to do this for years, and even though we’ve created hundreds of goodies, we still want every single one to be special for our customers.

Our aim, particularly with themed boxes, is to create items we haven’t seen anywhere in the market before, such as the hot dog cakes and cookie doughnuts in the Spring Fair Box. Creating new items require specialist moulds and considerable product development. Alongside the bakes, these boxes focus on the experience of how they can be enjoyed (cookie fries’ packet & cookie/dip cone etc).

With any new product there are always risks when trying to create something new, and pushing the boundaries of what you do. We appreciate we won’t always hit the mark with everybody, but we do always want to push ourselves to try and create new and special things for our customers. So absolutely, we take your comments on board for future boxes.

However, our recent delivery before Xmas arrived and was stale, the cookies were way too crumbly to dip them into any of the dips and they didn’t taste as the usually do… not sure if it’s cheaper ingredients, different bakers or what but was quite disappointed over Xmas!! My sister also had a delivery and said she had to throw away a brownie among other things because it was so dry, delivery for her was £12 too!!! Very expensive products for what you get, sadly.

Hi,
I've used your delivery service once before and it all went well.
However, this time it went drastically wrong; I'm in France and had to rely on delivery in the UK from companies over there this Christmas, I ordered the cookies for an address in Essex, they should have arrived in the week before Christmas but in fact, and with no explanation, they were returned to you.
I emailed as soon as I saw this and whilst I realise that you must have been flat out, I'm still waiting for a reply. Sorry, would love to use again but no confidence in your delivery company,",Date of experience: 06 January 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,"Hi Fiona!

2 reviews,Jayne,GB,Updated 17 Dec 2021,Order the cookies and hope no delivery issues,"I've made 5 orders, and the food items are fantastic apart from the chocolate bars are too thick to bite it's painful in my opinion- cookies and dips are great. Really the best.
However if you have issues don't expect a reply within a week or sometimes - at all. Which I didn't have after an order earlier in the year. I've had issues with deliveries and we had to travel 24 mile round trip to collect from the depot a few days later so the items weren't as fresh. I sent a DM on Instagram they replied three days later asking me to email. I emailed, I've had no reply for 9 days and now I'm writing this. No refund of postage offered for the delivery issues we've had and postage is not cheap!! The owner is on Instagram stories all day yet doesn't have time to reply to customers. They use DPD local who are absolutely useless round here, they went to a car wash and wardrobe shop instead of a home address.

Edit - I have had an email and social media response since leaving this review and a comment on insta which I appreciate. No refund of postage offered or alternative shipping options explored at this time. Really sad we won't have those incredible cookies in our future. Just can't be doing with the 24 mile round trip to the depot and the hours on the phone to dpd. Gutted.",Date of experience: 16 December 2021,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,17-Dec-21,"Hi Jayne!

Thanks for your feedback.

Firstly, we'd like to apologise for the delay in responding to you, we've been 3 members down this past week or so due to COVID so it's really been all hands on deck in the kitchen!

We're so glad to hear you love our cookies & dips! We work so hard making all our goodies so it's a shame to hear you've had issues with DPD. We've made notes of all your feedback regarding their service and will definitely pass it on so they can improve in the future!

The Cakesickles wouldn’t have been undercooked - as this is thoroughly checked, but they are mixed with buttercream to make them easier to eat, which may have given the texture you experienced.

If you had contacted us directly we would have definitely put it right however!

Thank you for taking the time to review us, we’re glad that part of the order was enjoyed and hopefully we will see you again.",Sians Sweet Treats,4.9

A whole chocolate orange cheesecake was my choice and as I live locally to the shop, I opted for collection. I picked the time and date, paid and received a confirmation email.
My order was ready at the allotted time and was a delight, both visually and taste-wise.
The shop stays open late into the evening so it fits in well with most work patterns.
Their cakes are so much nicer than standard shop-bought ones, well worth that bit extra for the sheer pleasure when eating them.",Date of experience: 22 June 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,09-Mar-23,Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your order!,Sians Sweet Treats,4.9

I would so love to be able to offer a lower delivery price but we quote the price that the courier charges to us.

Delivery: I had this delivered inside London and the process was smooth. The day before I was sent a tracking code for my one hour time slot. Through this on the day I could see when the courier had collected the cake, the estimated time to drop off, and a little icon on the map of where exactly the courier was. Therefore no anxious waiting for the doorbell.

The chocolate sponge is phenomenal. Moist, rich and slightly salted. I also thoroughly enjoyed their lemon ""tiramisu"" cake which was wonderfully light and summery. If you're on the hunt for a super fudgy brownie, they have you covered on that front too! Lastly, I am not really a matcha kinda-gal but I sampled their matcha cookie and must admit, I was impressed.

Only once have I been a little disappointed because I misunderstood the sizing of a slice of cake on their website. I questioned it with them and they rectified the wording immediately so others wouldn't be confused.

They are helpful over email and always very quick to respond. I also regularly order their letterbox specials for myself - delicious and always arrive quickly. I do find my preference is for the letterbox sizes to the packs of 4. The letterbox sizes are thinner, maybe this is a topping to brownie ratio thing for me?!
I don't mind the prices because I know they only use the best ingredients, which is a priority for me.

Anyway, love them and will continue to support an independent bakery.",Date of experience: 22 January 2024,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,08-Feb-24,"Wow, thank you so much for this review.

8 reviews,Miss Gilbertson,GB,24-Sep-23,The Best Baker that Ever Lived.,"I wish there were more stars available. Everything about EK Bakery is incredible, and I will forever be loyal to them. I have tasted a lot of brownies in my life, I have months without tasting Elizabeth's delights, and every time I order them again, I remember that hers are the best brownies on this earth - no exaggeration at all. The talent extends far beyond brownies too - if you've not tasted her blondies you also haven't lived, and likewise with any other baked goods that come out of that kitchen. I discovered EK Bakery many moons ago (pre pandemic maybe?) after asking her to custom bake me a Cherry Bakewell peanut butter brownie, and my all time fave, a Marmite Caramel Brownie. Since then I have asked for many a strange flavour combination, and she has yet to disappoint, allowing me to bend the rules on more than one occasion, and baking the weirdest of concoctions at my request. Thank you, Elizabeth - and you merry band of bakers. You make my baked goods dreams come true, and I salute you for it. Long may EK Bakery continue, and maybe one day I will cross the threshold in person. Until then, please continue to send me your chocolatey delights.

Many thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We offer cakes in multiple sizes and the mini size you had is our smallest one. It serves 2-6 people, depending on your portion preferences.

Additionally, we recommend storing the cake in the fridge and removing it around 1-2 hours before serving. The cake tastes best at room temperature but the refrigeration beforehand enables easy slicing and ensures a clean slice.

We'd love for you to try another cake with us, I'll follow up over email too.

They responded to my review stating they did not receive my previous emails and the cake last for 7 days. They also asked me to email them in order to issue a refund.

1 review,Customer,GB,Updated 28 Jul 2024,Horrible experience ordering a cake,"Horrible experience ordering a cake. The cake arrived upside down and very damaged. I emailed them and had a disrespectful email experience with the company manager.
I do not recommend this company because of their disrespectful treatment of customers, terrible delivery, and the discrepancy between what you order and what will actually arrive.
The photos on the website are not the same as the cake that will arrive. If you decide to order a cake from them, take screenshots of everything you see on the website, especially the description of the cake. I ordered The Red Velvet Cookie & Cream Cake and on the website it was listed with two types of cookies on top, but it arrived with only an Oreo cookie on top. I asked why and the manager told me to read the description, which allegedly stated that the cake would only have Oreo cookies. At the same time, on the day I ordered the cake, there was nothing about the absence of red cookies on it! So take screenshots of the cake description before ordering.

The company replied that they offered a refund. I agreed! I received an email that I was refunded 15 pounds. I did not receive the money on my card! And do you seriously think that 15 pounds is a normal refund amount for a ruined cake that does not match what I ordered? I paid £40 for the cake and £9 for delivery! I would have attached a photo if there was such an opportunity here.

And I repeat once again, the problem is not only the discrepancy between the photo and what I received, but first of all, the fact that the cake arrived almost DESTROYED!!!

I do not recommend this company!",Date of experience: 26 July 2024,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,28-Jul-24,"Customer complained saying the cake is not as described, however the description clearly states what toppings this cake has, we offered a refund but no reply.",Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

When I chased customer service for an update I was told the cake wouldn’t be delivered until 20th due to DPDs error and due to GDPR I’d have to chase DPD myself. Later they sent me an email confirming they hadn’t sent my item to DPD until the day I’d requested delivery and it was on a next day delivery service. When the cake arrived it was damaged. I requested a refund which they agreed to after seeing my pictures of £10. My advise would be to go elsewhere. There was never a straight answer from customer services. They seemed to say anything to get themselves off the hook including trying to throw DPD under the bus for their mistake.,Date of experience: 03 June 2024,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,,This was delivered and proof was shown by DPD.

Its professional as it has a description of the ingredients  used and gives out many options for the customers to choose from. When I chose the 6 cheesecakes, it had the options that my family member would like and she enjoyed them. This year I've decided to order from again but instead the 6 cake slices which was wonderful.

Firstly, three of the cheesecakes arrived completely out of shape, looking more like a mess than a dessert. It's clear that no care was taken in the packaging or handling of these items. To make matters worse, one of the cheesecakes was the incorrect flavor, which was frustrating since I had specifically chosen the varieties I wanted.

Additionally, there was no consistency between the base and the cheesecake topping. Some had overly thick bases, while others barely had any at all. The toppings were similarly inconsistent, with some being sparse and others overwhelming.

This order was meant to be a gift, but it was so embarrassing and insulting that I couldn't present it to the recipient. The quality and presentation were far below what I expected, and it completely ruined the occasion.

To top it off, dealing with Adrian from customer service was a nightmare. He takes no care in his emails or customer satisfaction and seems to only care about money. His lack of professionalism and disregard for customer concerns only added to my frustration.

This company is shocking, the customer service is false and they do not respond to your emails if there is anything negative to report. Only if it is positive. They claim to have contacted me offering a refund or another cake. THEY DID NOT. I wish I was able to attach all my emails  sent and attach all the correspondence they have sent which amounts to nothing, apart from a generic delivery email.

My first order was a bit disappointing as it came completely defrosted and a couple of cheesecakes were bashed, after I contacted your company you sent me the delivery charge back and said that you would pass the complaint on to your packing team.
I just wanted to let you know that I have received my second order today and what a difference, the cheesecakes are still frozen and the way it was packed was much better and finally none were bashed.
Thanks for listening to my previous complaint and rectifying it, well done.
Will definitely be ordering again, although there were mistakes first time round you sorted it out and rectified it, IMO that's what a great company should do, listen to your customers and sort any problems out.

I was sent the wrong cake for my little brothers birthday, it was delivered in bad condition (icing had melted and cake was lopsided, not to mention that it was NOT the cake I ordered and paid £43 for).

I emailed them as soon as it arrived. They ignored my emails and did not respond hence why I had to open a dispute on PayPal! I even messaged them on Instagram and even that was ignored.

They then refused to give me a refund via PayPal and had the cheek to ask me to return the cake which is a perishable item in order to get my refund, a cake that was 2.5 weeks old, icing half melted off. That cake went in the bin! If they had responded to my email in the first instance maybe I would’ve been able to do this but no, they chose to ignore me. They also tried to insult me further by saying I shouldn’t be allowed to keep the cake for free - maybe the company shouldn’t be allowed to send out the wrong cakes to customers and try and steal customers money?!!!!!!

To summarise, they did not deliver what I had paid for and their response has been atrocious, I have not even received an apology yet for them sending me the wrong item which is shocking. I understand mistakes can happen but they have not even taken accountability or wanted to rectify this error on their behalf.

But my friend has now received a set of 6 battenburg cupcakes, which were clearly not what I ordered.

Ordered 6 expensive mini cheesecakes for a special occasion and paid £9 extra for specific day delivery.

They had not arrived on the day I had requested although I had put the order in a week prior to this. They are now due to arrive today 2 days after the schedule date. I had requested a refund as I am now away from home so will not receive the product whilst they are fresh.They said they could do this if I returned the product but specified if they go off the refund would not be processed!

Makes me question what they do with there returned cakes … ship them back out to the next customer ?

Anyways I’ve waisted £31 on 6 mini cheesecakes and I can see there are similar reviews.

Note to the response below. As mentioned my order was delivered 2 days late to my office address in Bradford whilst I was down in Bristol until the Monday. they made it clear if the product was returned out of date they would not refund. Obviously the product would be out of date as it has been in shipment since the 07/05/24 and I wouldn’t be able to post it back until the 13/05/24.",Date of experience: 10 May 2024,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,,This item was delivered and customer has not returned and has kept this therefore not entitiled to any refund?,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

1 review,Hana,GB,Updated 19 Jun 2024,Avoid at all costs,"I ordered a carrot cake for fathers day. The website states it arrives frozen and in a strong corrugated box, with dry ice, foam and protective brackets.

I got a smushed defrosted carrot cake in a cheap shoe box stuffed into a DPD bag.

I gave the business every opportunity to put it right but their Sales and Customer Services Manager (who will no doubt reply to this review with more lies) refused to follow the law, even when I explained it to him in great detail. I wanted to return the cake for a replacement or refund but they refused to cover the costs of the return, even though it's their legal duty to do so.

In order to get your money back follow these instructions:
1. Contact Desserts Delivered and ask them to organise the return of the damaged item for a refund, this is their legal duty but they will deny it (and may even accuse you of blackmail LOL)
2.Contact Citizens Advice by phone or online form and say Desserts Delivered have delivered goods that are not satisfactory and you are exercising your short term right to reject.
They will send you a template letter to send to Desserts Delivered.
3.Send that and if they again refuse to refund you you can claim the money back from the bank.

I have also asked Citzens Advice to make Trading Standards aware, feel free to add your own experiences when you contact Citizens Advice. I have been given a case number.

My advice, avoid this company like the plague. What you see on the website is not what you will receive! The recent 1 star reviews and the business response to them tell you everything you need to know.

EDITED TO ADD: You can see exactly what I mean about customer service in the reply. I haven’t mentioned the taste of the cake anywhere because the cake is uneaten, still damaged, in its box. They have admitted that they are happy to break the law and get away with it because they have a “close relationship” with trading standards.

Didn't have anytime to wait for another so bought a pack of biscoff and spent about an hour trying to make the top look half decent.

Customer service offered £5 for my troubles.

Told them to keep it, as that didn't even cover the delivery cost!!

Rubbish cakes and even worse customer service.

Had a reply saying 1 bit of chocolate broken, the top was flattened. Pity I can't post images.

Update, desserts delivered have tried on two occasions to remove this review, 2nd time denying ever supplying me.

If a company goes this far trying to stop negative reviews the score on here is a total fabrication of reality.

Had I not had an order number, copy of the receipt and an email thread from Charlie in customer services it probably would and still could be taken down.

Customer services a joke. Charlie told me they had tried to call me to say they couldn’t make the ordered cake. I have no missed calls. He then said I’d requested a cheaper version and they’d upgraded my order. I sent him a copy of my invoice where it clearly states i ordered and paid for the deluxe version. I asked him to send a replacement, he said he would if I sent the received cake back. I agreed. Since then nothing despite sending several emails,… do not waste your money!!

3 reviews,Lis Harrison kent,GB,23-Feb-24,Terrible customer service and poor product,"A Biscoff cake ordered for my son's 18th Birthday. When we opened the cake (on his birthday) the wrong cake was in the box that we had no alternative to use because we had no time to source an alternative cake.
When I contacted the 'Charlie' at the company he/she told me that they had ""run out of Biscoff cakes so had decided to send us an alternative cake'!
I had assumed that an honest mistake had been made but to hear that the company had taken the decision to send a random cake with NO effort to contact me and ask if I would like to cancel the order or receive a different cake was really disappointing.
The company was un apologetic and said that they would only refund the order if I sent back the cake (at my expense) un used. This was obviously impossible as we did not have time to source another cake which the company would have known.

The actual cake that arrived was very unattractive and completely unsuitable for my son's 18th. It was covered in neon orange and over sweet (more suited to 5 year old).

I am seriously disappointed with the lack of customer service and disappointing product that arrived and would definitely not recommend this company based on our experience.",Date of experience: 22 January 2024,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,23-Feb-24,"We tried to call you before we sent this cake and replaced when we could not get in touch as we never like to leave a customer without, we sent a more expensive cake",Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

Ordered a 6 box of brownies as a secret Santa present. But was sent some miniature brownies which is not what I ordered. Tried to contact them and it took ages for them to respond and the response was that they tried to call me. I had no missed calls or a voicemail. Their response has now been for me to send the brownies back for a refund, 2 weeks after they were delivered to me. Why should I have to pay to send an item back I did not order and why would they want brownies back that they can not resell. Also when I looked at the brownies they looked so dry. Will not be using this service ever again, such a disappointment.

Today the cupcakes have arrived. NO CAKE. Yesterday I also needed to change the order. Telephoned. Was told to email. Have now emailed 4 times. No reply. Have telephoned again 3 times. No reply. What am I supposed to do now? Shocking service.

Update: see their rather snippy reply. Interesting that they reply to this review but have yet to fulfill their promise to reply within 5 hours to an email - 24 hours and counting. Also, I have only received information from the courier regarding ONE parcel, not two, so even now I am not convinced that the cake will arrive. On top of that, the cupcakes arrived in an enormous polystyrene box easily big enough to fit the cake- not great in terms of carbon footprint to send two packages. And never mind you can’t reach them by phone at all either- it just rings out.

New update - still no email, call, delivery…

Latest update - 21 Sept- the cake never did arrive, my autistic son was very upset, and I have yet to receive a proper apology or refund.

New update 21 Sept - just went on to Instagram and found this message from them - I’ll let you judge for yourselves the professionalism of this company!

Better off with a supermarket or something you’ve seen before. Sent the wrong cake and then told that they tried to call me. No email sent, their number is not on their website so I can’t even validate that they rang me and doesn’t justify that I got sent a cake which I had not ordered and they should not take orders or advertise product they don’t have- that’s the definition of a scam. Cake that arrived had cheap broken biscuits and some weird looking smearing on the box and packaging- very messy. Unprofessional when contacted to check why I’d been sent the wrong cake. Refused to send a returns slip even though this is what they say on their website. Refused to refund the shipping I had to pay to ship the return and despite DPD notifying them of the delivery coming they didn’t bother to change it to a delivery that would suit them so it was delivered next door and they claim they don’t have it. Don’t buy and save yourself the headache. Should have trusted my instinct when I saw some of the images with wonky cakes.

Following my review the company flagged my review to be taken down despite not responding to the proof of returns I sent them. They asked for an order number to back my review. I provided this and they continued to flag the review as false. I have now had to send the email exchange to TrustPilot. No professional business deals with customers in that way.

3 reviews,Lou PR,GB,Updated 5 Apr 2024,Not a Serious Company,"Like Imogen below, I have also had an issue with delivery (first missed agreed date and then non-delivery), and been refused a refund.

They also told me they have proof it was delivered - which may be correct, but it was not delivered to me. I have spoken with DPD who, after investigating, have confirmed the cake was delivered to wrong address and as it is perishable goods, they can not do anything about this. Screenshots of this conversation with DPD were sent to company as proof.

I have explained to the company my contract is with them and not DPD, so it is up to them to refund me and take it up with DPD themselves. This absurd company is having none of it though; their emails are rude and curt. I’m pretty sure it’s just one person who runs the company who doesn’t know what they are doing, cos all emails sound the same childish, and clueless tone.

Anyway, I have given them until Thursday to issue the refund before I request a chargeback via Bank, and then a Small Claim if that isn’t successful. I will update this review then to let everyone know if they refunded or not.

I’m sure the cake maker will be on here soon to respond to this in the same manner they responded to Imogen below. I know what they said to Imogen is lies, cos it’s the same lies they are telling me, so take it with a pinch of salt, and just avoid this clown company.

UPDATE (04.04.24): I have heard nothing back from the company since, and received no refund. I have just lodged the dispute with my bank to request a chargeback (this was really simple to do in my banking app (Monzo); so if you’ve also been ripped off by this company (or any other) - please consider this process too!)

Will update again in due course.

UPDATE 2 04.04.23: Less than 90 minutes after starting the dispute with my bank, I have received a full refund via the dispute.

3 reviews,ANN W,GB,Updated 11 Oct 2023,You're not guaranteed to get what you order and they don't tell you what was delivered instead.,"Ordered cookie pies for my son. He received brownies. How can a company, that states on their website that they bake fresh daily, not have the items in stock, that they know they have orders to fulfill?
If they had contacted me I wouldn't have chosen brownies, but its a poor service when they just send whatever they have in stock.

My son enjoyed the brownies, but he regularly makes brownies himself. The cookie pies were a special treat.

Their initial response was to ask for proof as they didn't seem to know what had been supplied. Their next was to briefly apologise and tell me the cookie pies were out of stock. The next reply was to state they had supplied more expensive brownies- when in fact they were the same price.
I think their sales and customer services manager, Charlie, needs to attend training to teach him how to write emails and how to respond to complaints. Letting customers know when they can't supply an item would be a good idea too!

His last ditch offer was an offer to supply more brownies but it was a very insincere response and I didn't want more brownies!!
'If you want i will send him some brownies free o charge for the issues?' was all he wrote.

Definitely won't be using this company again. They obviously don't value their customers.

1 review,taher khaliq,GB,Updated 29 Jan 2024,Cake is smaller than advertised,"We ordered 2 of the chocolate rainbow cakes for our child's birthday from Desserts Delivered. The website says the size is 7"" and what we received is 6"" in diameter. After raising this with them they said the cakes height should be 7"" and not the diameter. So I measured the height and it was 4"" cake and 1.5 additional inch for the rainbow topper.

Now I fully expect some approximation as these are hand made cakes but both the ones I ordered have the same measurements (6"" x 4"" - 5.5"" including decoration) which is not as advertised on the site so can't be a mistake.
This is misinformation on the site and at £40 per cake...

I raised all this and sent them photo evidence. No partial compensation was offered. Only a full refund if I returned both cakes at my expense. They did not mention if they would cover shipping. What I wanted was a nominal refund (£10 or £11) as a gesture but they said no to that suggestion. As the party was the next day and no time to order cakes from elsewhere, there was no choice but to use the cakes.

The money isn't the big thing. Its the several emails with their team and them not admitting to the size discrepancies even after I sent photos. At the end of the day it impacts your children's birthday.


** Added after their reply ***
What I asked for was a nominal refund total of £10 for the mis-selling of the sizes of 2 cakes as a gesture but they rejected that. The sizes displayed on the site did not match what was sent at all. They said I had to return the birthday cake to get any refund at all. That is not practical a day before the birthday when it's too late to order another cake from somewhere else. What would have been great is to provide the sizes stated. I provided photo evidence of the actual sizes.

I get this was obviously done in transit, so I emailed desserts delivered bakery straight away to inform them & sent several photos(shame I can’t upload them on here) to show how bad the damage was, the famous ‘Charlie’ who’s name seems to pop up on here with all the bad reviews, responded to say “would I like some money back?” So obviously I said yes, as i was now going to have to go out an spend even more money on things to try and cover All the damage & try & some how make it presentable for the birthday party in less than 24 hours time!

So I responded asking what is going on with my refund he offered, to which Charlie then back tracked and said I wasn’t getting a refund unless I return the damaged cake ..out of my OWN pocket!  I explained I didn’t want a full refund, and I have said this over and over again via email, and that it was too late to return it as the party was the following day and I wouldn’t be paying more money to return something that was damaged by someone else! Since then Charlie has proceeded to ignore the majority of my emails, refused to give any partial refund even though it was him who originally offered one, and told me I won’t be getting a refund unless I pay for it to be returned, because “that isn’t how a buisness works”!

The company is a total scam and should not be aloud to trade.

13/09
Finally a response from yourselves you certainly have not replied to any emails and I have definitely NEVER sent a email saying I have received the cake. You despatched so check tracking details provided by courier you can clearly see the cake has never got to me and the courier has returned to you which you had over a week ago. Still no refund or mention of a refund you have not contacted me what so ever so you clearly do not reply to all emails as I have sent 8 in total along with Facebook msgs

If desserts delivered would like to actually email me I will do the work for you and send you the DHL link which even has a photo from them to prove you have the cake back and that it has never come to me… as they neveer ever delivered it

Final chaser on 7th September and they just refunded me the £10, but still no response back.

Just seen their response - they refunded the money as soon as I said I’m going to leave a bad review. Why did it take from the 28th July on my first email to the 7th September to do that? I wish I could post screenshots of the 5 emails I sent, 2 Instagram messages and multiple Facebook messages, so the fact they said they tried to contact me is a complete lie because they never did or respond to me messaging them.",Date of experience: 28 July 2023,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10-Sep-23,We refunded the difference for the cheaper cake as we could not get in touch to offer a replacement to the customer.

2 reviews,Tracey,GB,Updated 9 Sept 2023,Extremely poor customer service,"I ordered cupcakes for my husbands birthday where they were delivered but unfortunately they were inedible on delivery due to them being in transit all day in the hot weather. When my husband opened the package there was only 1 small pack of dry ice in there which wasn’t enough to keep them at the correct temperature for the journey. Unfortunately we had to throw the cupcakes away as they were not edible due to the heat which made the topping melt ! I emailed desserts delivered straight away to explain that I was not happy with my delivery and wanted a full refund for the cakes we could not enjoy, however the sales/customer service manager told me the cupcakes were fine and that I won’t be getting a refund unless I returned the cupcakes !! Which for one would have been at my cost of sending them back causing me to waste more money on something I had already paid for and was unhappy with plus I had thrown them in the bin which I explained. I was then met with a few more rude emails stating that I was lying and trying to rip off a small family business. To be honest I’ve never experienced bad customer service like this I was in shock that now it remains that I’m more unhappy with the way I have been treated as a customer than the cupcakes themselves. If you work in customer service like I do you make sure your customers come first and you do what you can to make them happy. Not one apology or offer to replace the cupcakes nothing but rude emails which I still have and will keep. I feel whilst this business clearly has some amazing feedback from happy customers they also need to deal with the unhappy ones with a good customer attitude and try to help to make there experience better. I did email them this and said that had they of done something to help or apologised or something I would of been a returning customer where I would order more cupcakes however I was met with a rude reply saying oh well I’m sure we will cope without you as a customer. It’s a shame that this has happened and it has left me very upset more so with the response from this company than the cupcakes themselves. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour and customer service non existent!!",Date of experience: 05 September 2023,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,07-Sep-23,"From the images shown the cupcakes are not melted and fine to eat, They do not need to be ""frozen""",Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

2 reviews,Carla Greer,GB,Updated 17 Aug 2023,"Good products, poor customer service","Ordered a box of 6 mini cheesecakes for my birthday - BIscoff and White Chocolate ones were great, the oreo ones had turned so were inedible.
I raised it with their team on the 27/7 - have chased 3 times and finally got a response today from their sales and customer service manager offering me some discount on future orders but no specification of how much. Not good enough really given I spent £30 and a 3rd of the order was not edible. Pretty sure I would have a case with trading standards for them not providing goods as paid for - instead I'll just leave reviews everywhere I can in the hope they see them. Overall - good product offering but the very poor customer service lets them done - I shouldn't have had to chase a 'customer service manager' 3 times to get a response to my complaint. Shame, as I won't be ordering again.
REPLY: At NO point did the company ask me to return the products - I would have been happy to do so. The oreo cookie ones tasted 'fizzy' like food does when it has turned.

These are issues with the delivery company and not the baker but when raised with Desserts Delivered the lack of service was very apparent. Told they will investigate with courier, chased 4 times in 3 weeks THEN told to return if wished a refund (after 3 weeks?), it was already in the bin by then. Also told that they guarantee only the delivery date but it was delivered at night after I waited in all day (I am expected to wait in on a Friday evening too- beyond business hours). NO understanding that their responsibility is to hold the courier to account (cake showed as signed for, but I had no idea it was there and did not sign for it). Had to replace the cake in a mad rush. Im sure it would be fine if the courier did their job but if you do need the help of Desserts Delivered then forget it, offered the postage refund but I preferred to share my feedback so that others don't waste their money. I didn't consider the damage to be minor, left out all night in the frost. I also didn't consider being repeatedly blanked good service, but then perhaps Im fussy. Shame to have to argue with them but they seem to think Im trying to get a free cake and miss the point that the cake was not as I paid for and had to be replaced.",Date of experience: 19 May 2023,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,08-Jun-23,"Hi Lindsay, The cake was delivered on the date you picked, No answer at the door so the courier left in a safe place, The cake had a minor crack in it, We did offer a partial refund but you declined and also a full refund when returning the unwanted item.

REPLY…

You have already sent me an email stating I will only get a refund if I take this review down regardless whether the cake is returned or not?? The cake arrived in the end, damaged, squashed plus the pop up card which arrived which was suppose to have a hand written note that I typed on your website page??

8 reviews,Tara,GB,Updated 22 Jun 2023,Poor service failed delivery,"I ordered a cake on Thursday for delivery on the 27th May! I emailed to confirm the delivery date would actually be the delivery date as the confirmation email of my order was a little confusing. I got a reply to say yes the delivery would definitely be on the 27th. However DHL sent a email to say there had been an update with delivery and it would not be delivered today 27th my sons 11 birthday! Instead it would be with us on the next working day which is Tuesday(due to bank holiday) which is no good and the cake will have been decorated and spoilt by then. No reply from the email this morning or telephone from either the cake company or DHL £52 wasted.

Update 28th May.
Had a email saying they would only refund me, if I removed the review on trust pilot as it’s defamation… and that I should have perhaps ordered it with more notice. Well, I have a paper trail specifically asking if the cake would be delivered on time, and Martin, sales manager you said yes it would be! Funny how you didn’t reply to phone calls and emails yesterday. Yet you fully responded when I put a review on here. Martin darling, I’m suggesting that you should consider, perhaps some Continued Professional Development (CPD), such as a customer service course? I’m sure holding customers refunds to ransom over trust pilot reviews definitely won’t be anywhere in the course materials.
May 30th Update
Since putting this review on here the company said I had lied about turn of unfortunate events and flagged my review to trust pilot. I gladly gave them requested evidence. Also DHL tried to deliver the cake today (30th) of which I refused, they tried to hand it to me upside down, clearly the box was marked this way up with directional arrows pointing upwards - delivery drivers reply was “oh yeah didn’t see that there”. I have been offered a refund, for which I am yet to see, and refused the offer to keep the cake.
Don’t order from this company as they dispute everything you say and call you a liar. Can’t comment on the cake which is a shame really.

4 reviews,Matt,GB,Updated 8 May 2023,Terrible customer service,"Extremely poor customer service and a plethora of excuses with no action or delivery refund after the cake was not delivered to my address. They admitted they were having problems with the delivery in email exchanges before ignoring multiple requests for a refund of just £6.99 for the delivery, a service I did not receive. The only option they gave was to return the cake 3 weeks later for a full refund only after I escalated the claim to PayPal. The cake was fine but they do not care if you have any problems after you pay them.

Edit: as you can see the level of absolute arrogance in their reply confirms my review title, this is indicative of all their responses. As if I would waste my time writing this if it was actually delivered. There is one entrance to my property yard covered by cctv, there was no attempt at delivery, I have the recording for the full day and offered it to them.

2 reviews,HH,GB,Updated 25 Apr 2023,Failed to deliver the product 3 separate times!,"Failed to deliver the cheesecakes I ordered for a birthday 3 times. First time was for a birthday which was missed - they blamed the courier despite the courier emailing me an update the day before stating they hadn’t received the item for delivery. I was told it would then be the Monday - again this was missed. We agreed a further date (6 days after the birthday this was for) and it still didn’t arrive - the excuse this time was that I hadn’t confirmed I wanted it delivered on that date. My opinion is that as we were having an email discussion about finally getting the product I’d paid delivered this was very heavily implied but apparently not as I didn’t end my final email with, ‘yes please deliver on Thursday’. Even if I give the benefit of the doubt shouldn’t they have been chasing up to ensure their 2 previous mistakes were rectified?
Terrible customer service (Martin gave no apologies or acknowledgment of the poor service and was sometimes emailing at 1am - maybe they are too busy to manage properly? The approach appears to be to make you feel like you’re going mad and to lie in the emails however I did get a full refund when I requested this which seems better than others have had.
Ridiculous company who can’t fulfil what they agree to do - deliver cakes on time or at 2 further dates - please avoid avoid avoid!
***addition since adding this review - this company are trying to claim this review is not genuine. They are either complete liars or ridiculously useless! I provided the extra info requested and a simple search of my email address would have shown 20+ emails I sent to them to still not receive the cheesecakes!? I’ve now had to submit photographic evidence to trust pilot of the order as the company don’t believe it is genuine even though they responded to the review saying I’d been refunded!?

2 reviews,Zoëy Brothwell,GB,14-Apr-23,One star is even too much for this…,"One star is even too much for this absolutely shocking, dishonest, useless excuse of a company. DO NOT ORDER.
The company not only didn’t make the cake in time they then LIED and said there was issues with Parcel force and it wasn’t their problem. After stating they’d posted the cake too late anyway, and I wanted a refund they said they couldn’t due to it being perishable. On their website it states you can have a refund up to 30 days. First load of waffle.
They then offered me 50% back. I didn’t want the cake the party had been and I was then £25 out of pocket for a cake that had been “in the post” for 5 days!!!
After many emails back and forth they reluctantly said to post back.
£10 postage, a photo at the post office, proof of postage and confirmation that it HAD been delivered to their depot, the pathetic excuse of a sales manager Martin, then lied yet again, and said it hadn’t been delivered.
Luckily I paid through PayPal, raised the dispute and they had to pay me back.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! Save yourself the hassle, go to M&S and get a scrummy cake off the shelf and make it your own!

The cake was not fine, it was delivered upside down. There was also missing and incorrect items in my order. Customer service dude (most likely the owner) very funny though. Messaging me @ midnight on a Saturday and emailing to say even though he already said he’d actioned the refund that he wouldn’t now because of my review lol I paid by credit card so the bank will sort that for me & email trail is comedy to be shared. But really appreciate all the extra attention from ‘Martin’.

Cake delivered upside down the day before the party and destroyed. Not able to speak to anyone on the phone, customer service (Martin) was useless. The cake was not fit for use and they were only willing to give a 50% refund (which they are delaying processing whilst arguing over email) stating that to get a full refund I would need to pay to send the cake back special delivery (in a cost of living crisis when I now have to go and source a new cake the day before my wife’s 30th birthday).

I then contacted the cake company. They were marvelous. Kept in contact with me, even emailing as late as midnight on the Thursday. The cake was delivered on the Friday.

UPDATED,"FINAL UPDATE: I was finally offered a full refund after I called out the lies and poor service here on Trustpilot and you will see above my review has been verified after providing all the evidence to Trustpilot. Needless to say I have NOT received the refund which was offered on condition of removing this review. Good news I raised a dispute with American Express and they have credited my account after I supplied them the evidence.

READ THE GENUINE POOR REVIEWS BEFORE USING THIS COMPANY!!

UPDATED: Desserts Delivered Bakery really don’t like real customer experiences to become public. Trustpilot Content Integrity have been in touch as DDB have challenged my review, I have supplied all supporting documents which will verify my review. I have also provided all email correspondence which also prove that at no time was I offered a partial refund instead I was offered 50% off a future purchase, knowing full well I would never order from this company again. I was told that my email would be passed to the complaints department, they must be inundated as I’m still awaiting a response. The cake was awful and the service is even worse! END OF UPDATE.

Selected the new Biscoff cake for a birthday party, it was well packaged but the cake itself was packed in a plastic bag. The bag was welded to the caramel drizzle so when removing it most of the caramel ended up staying in the bag, the cake looks a mess and I’m really disappointed, I contacted company and sent pictures who offered 50% off next purchase!! I will not be using them again considering the cost of cake and delivery, really wish I’d taken the time to use a local bakery.",Date of experience: 04 April 2023,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,,"Full refund offered, Hope you enjoyed the cake.

They just kept telling me that they tried to call me. I had no missed calls on my phone so I know they didn't. The response I got was constantly ""we did not want to leave anyone without a cake"", which is fair enough but no acknowledgement that they hadn't tried to contact me.

6 reviews,MCJ VFX,GB,Updated 22 Apr 2023,7 Hours late and cake left in the rain…,"7 Hours late and cake left in the rain all day ( at back door of 179 and were at 197 ). Parcelforce also getting a poor review. Avoid online deliveries. They assured us cake packing was waterproof ( probably splash proof ) but left all day in elements and a particularly rainy day.

Cake ruined and had to buy replacement the next day and the cake missed party anyway.

Passed buck to Parcelforce who finally found it ( too late ). Wont online a cake again. Disaster …

Your reply sums the experience up really .. thats a lie as he didn't know where it was. Parcelforce delivery person went to recover it at the end of his shift.He didn't call at house .. he admitted he got the ‘numbers mixed up’ …It was at 179 … not 197 all day. He didn’t call at our house until 645PM.He dropped it at wrong house at 12.05PM ..Which is why he had to go and recover it 6 hours later as data protection prevents them releasing addresses (they send a picture) they also cant text or call drivers during shifts according to their customer teams who said he never should of left it . Ive sent proof including your replies to Trust Pilot. Including your emails .. where it shows the events Ive described with security footage.

Offered to refund from Martin … but only if I removed the review. Please shop elsewhere for your occasions cant be trusted and looking at reviews I am not alone..

2 reviews,REBORN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT LT,GB,Updated 8 Mar 2023,Very disappointing..,"Update: Flagging this review as fake and deleting social media reviews.... shame on you.... awful service. I'm speaking with trading standards. Expect a letter and action.

Very disappointing... my wife ordered a cake for my birthday but the cake didn't arrive on time despite the next day delivery promise and the wrong cake arrived.

When she emailed to complain about the wrong cake they told her they had tried to contact her however this was untrue, she had also emailed whilst waiting for the cake so there was plenty of opportunity to communicate with her...

She is upset as the cake was for my birthday and the one that arrived was the wrong flavour.. (hazelnut) she knows I hate hazelnut so I couldn't even pretend for her to feel better.

It wasn't eaten and Martin lied regarding contact and no refunds offered.

Terrible response.... no further business from me

Also flagging my review as a fake experience. This is how you fail at customer service and make customers so insane with anger they take to social media to spread the news about just how badly they are treated.

Also you need to read your terms and conditions... full refund refused unless we send back the old dry cake at our own expense?

Cake is in the bin... it was a week before you replied to the complaint.... You know full well any sensible person won't be sending back perishable items at their own expense to claw back a perfectly reasonable request for a refund. I will just dedicate my life to reminding people not buy your products.... watch this space....

Martin the customer service agent clearly needs to learn the basics of customer service....",Date of experience: 28 February 2023,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,,"As per our terms and conditions, if a cake is for some reason out of stock we do replace with the most equivalent.

We received an email stating DPD are on strike (utter lies) to try and enforce their ambiguous Ts&Cs. DPD are not on strike, they’re experiencing delays due to Xmas deliveries and Royal Mail disruptions. That’s nothing to do with us or them for that matter, as their delivery partner isn’t Royal Mail. They possibly have the worst customer service I’ve ever encountered. They’ve stated in a previous post that 99.9% of their deliveries on delivered on time. You know what they should do with the other 0.1% of orders that aren’t delivered on time? Refund the customer to avoid this hassle, it’ll barely make an impact on their overall profit margin. They’ll actually be able to claim compensation of £25 from DPD for missed delivery. But they won’t tell you this. Absolutely disgusting customer service. Once again, avoid this company.

I will never order again

Myself and family have ordered before many times without issues

On this occasion I placed an order on 23.11.22 for the ferrero and creme egg, I received on 26.11.22

Both cakes were inedible

The buttercream tasted greasy and of just raw butter making the cakes inedible

We contacted customer service and received a reply from Martin , the replies are the most absurd replies ever received from any company e.g. he point blank refused to acknowledge the issue stating that they had had thousands of orders this week and since they had (apparently) received no complaints I must therefore be in accurate and he could do nothing about it. He also said I would have to return the cake in full for a refund which makes no sense

I would have returned the cake as it is with a few bites taken out of it but he refused

The replies are strange making me question that this is really someone of managerial status

I have reported the company to my bank and advise everyone here to always pay with a credit card so you can claim against such fraudulent behaviour

Ordered a cake to be delivered to my mum on holiday for her 50th birthday. Ordered online and selected delivery for the day before which was confirmed. The following day I received an email saying that DPD would deliver the cake 3 days after the date I requested (the email also stated that they were due to collect the cake suggesting that it had not yet been posted). I attempted to contact desserts delivered however could not find a number but had to email. Reply received the following day saying that they had requested the day I asked for and the fault was with the delivery company. I explained that my mum would no longer be at the holiday site once the cake arrived and that it would be inedible by the time it was received (even if she was still at the holiday site). I requested a refund and was told that I would be passed onto the complaints department however never received any further emails. Contacted them again several days later requesting a refund, informed that they would not refund me as the cake had been signed for. I explained that this had been signed for by the resort staff and despite this had been in transit for 4 days rendering it inedible. Contained to refuse a refund, I was offered a replacement however as it had already gone past my mother's birthday and I had to pay for a local baker to make her a last minute alternative, a replacement would be pointless.

They claimed to have tried to ring me before to warn me but I didn't receive any missed calls, messages or emails. I contacted customer service to resolve and had the most frustrating customer experience I've ever had. They couldn't send the correct order and would only refund the item price if I sent the incorrect order back and paid for the return shipping myself (on top of the £6.99 original shipping fee which they wouldn't refund either). In the end they were only able to refund 50% of the item price (minus the £6.99 shipping fee) even though I didn't order this item and couldn't use as the recipient didn't like which has left me out of pocket. Awful service and really frustrating, would not use again. UPDATE TO RESPONSE: I didn't ""claim"" the order was wrong - it was wrong. I have evidence and the full email chain to prove this, as does Trustpilot when the company tried to flag this as a fake review. The company only offered a full refund after I posted this review, in exchange for me removing it from this site.",Date of experience: 04 November 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,11-Nov-22,"We sent out the item ordered which customer claimed was wrong, we asked to return and a full refund or replacement will be sent but they did not, Hope you enjoyed the cupcakes!",Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

1 review,Matthew,GB,03-Nov-22,Worst customer service I have received…,"Worst customer service I have received in a long time.

I ordered cupcakes for a friends special birthday.
They delivered a different style of cupcake to the ones I had ordered because they were out of stock, but they did not notify me of this in advance.
When contacted they agreed to swap the cupcakes. (I have all this in email)
But they did not send out the correct ones or collect the unwanted ones.

I emailed yesterday after I was made aware by my friend that they had failed to correct their error.
When I asked that the correct ones be sent I was responded to with a blunt request for me to send back the unwanted cupcakes first at my own expense before they would send out the ones I had ordered.

I explained that two weeks had passed since the delivery issue and as my friends didn’t like the ones ordered they were thrown away.

Also I challenged why should it be my responsibility to pay for postage of the wrongly delivered item.

Again their blank response back was to offer me a discount if I bought from cakes them again in the future but that they would not send out what I had ordered unless I could send back the unwanted ones.

Again I have all this in email.

13 reviews,Tess Carr,GB,Updated 7 Nov 2022,"Not hand made AVOID, customer service SHOCKING","Having ordered the rainbow chocolate cake from a place that ""have a team of bakers"" for Each cake you order for your autistic son saves me having to stand all day and we can enjoy his time.
Paid the premium for next day delivery and was very happy when it arrived.
I had ordered cheesecakes too one of which was a bit battered in transit. But nothing to get annoyed about until we done the candle on the actual cake.
I've written them an email saying I did wonder about the toppings as it wasn't as the website showed but never thought anything at the time.
I have for years had him a rainbow cake which never looks like the standard one from the outside so he always gets excited at that part.
We slice the cake and as I'm pulling his slice out I say surprise and his face drops as does mine because they sent a complete different cake.
This cake got a slice taken from it at half 5 on a Saturday night there's no way a mum can fix this.
It's currently in the bin all mashed and whatever and the response I got today was well you got a more expensive cake than you ordered.
The exact response below....

""So sorry about this it looks like you have been sent another cake in error being the ten layer fudge cake which is £7 more than what you paid! Deepest apologies for this, let me know if you order in the future and i will arrange some discount for the mistake so sorry, it looks like it has been used and ate so we hope you enjoyed!

Man - Sales & Customer Service Manager ""

So how would we know we had the wrong cake without taking a slice?
Where's the compassion for the autistic child who now was so upset he didn't want ANYTHING.

These are not baked by bakers they can't be, I ordered rainbow, the box said ferrero and now they have came back saying I got fudge cake? Seems nobody knows what they are selling and don't care about the aftermath.
Absolutely disgusting company.
I say AVOID!!!

The company have since tried twice to have my review removed? ?? Suspect it's because their lack of customer service, compassion or attention to details have been questioned.

Although I will add the caramac cheesecakes where lovely.

**update as they have now written a reply ***

The cake in question was missing a slice in that picture because of the reason I bought your cake, it should have been a rainbow inside. If I hadn't cut it at all then how would I have known you sent the wrong order.
Still now coming back with an arrogant response, at no point was I offered a partial refund, I was however offered ""some sort of a discount"" then by the 25th I'm told if I return the cake I can get a refund. And seriously with the attitude of your company I'd have happily got it out of the bin however by then our collection had been made by the council.
Although completely irrelevant,
I at no point asked for a free cake, I pay my own way thank you very much.

My biggest complaint came after you decided to make out your company done me a favour by giving me a cake that according to your emails was £7 dearer now you say six.
I really do wish this trust pilot allowed photos since you now have the audacity to claim we ate half of that cake!

Your customer service is disgraceful, while your company are ""only human"" & send out hundreds of cakes. Maybe research the complaint first and foremost before attempting to slate someone on the reviews.
apparemtly having added the cusomer service name invades their privacy yet i did read reviews on here that they replied to saying they'd pass on the praise to the person in question.
THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT YOU PUT IN TO MY REVIEW .... SHAME YOU COULDNT ACTUALLY DO THE SAME WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER EH!!!",Date of experience: 22 October 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,01-Nov-22,"Hi Tess
As previously explained in our emails; you were sent the wrong cake in error, we send hundreds of cakes a day and are only human, sometimes mistakes can happen. We are also a small business who can not afford to give people free cakes in these tough times, We offered a partial refund or you to return the ""unwanted"" half eaten cake. You declined to both offers. You were even sent a cake £6 more than the one that was ordered.
Glad you liked our cheesecakes and judging by the size of the slice taken from the fudge cake it looks like you enjoyed that too!

1 review,Michael Norman,GB,01-Oct-22,Worth every penny for that special treat,"I have ordered from Desserts Delivered Bakery twice now, and on both occasions the cakes have looked exactly like the pictures and from a taste perspective have been amazing. I was dubious initially about how they would hold up in transit but both were beautifully packaged and the method using the ice packs works a treat. The only downside is the inevitable family fights over who has had the most slices, the cake still tastes great after a few days and is incredibly moist however I would be surprised if you haven’t eaten it by then! If you are looking for a treat for a special occasion then look no further, yes you could pick up something from the supermarket that looks the part however in my eyes the taste and texture will be leagues below these, and the look on the recipients face is worth the extra as they will feel extra special! I must also add that the customer service is commendable and personable so you really can’t go wrong.",Date of experience: 01 October 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,09-Oct-22,"Hi Michael,

2 reviews,BP,GB,Updated 2 Jul 2022,Disappointing,"Ordered a cake which should have arrived yesterday. Full details of the address it should have arrived had been detailed, however parcel was delivered to somewhere (no idea where) and order now closed (with no cake). I paid £8 odd for delivery and it can’t even be delivered to the right place and have been charged for this. Have emailed and not had any response, also tried calling and no response. See previous review regarding courier delivery and their responsibility, it is also the responsibility of the company themselves to make sure the courier they use are actually delivering the item as it should be and where it should be safely.

Further follow up after response from seller:

I was told I had to chase and find the order from Dpd, which as per citizens advice is incorrect as it is the sellers duty to chase the courier for delivery. I was told the cake was signed for and delivered to the address on the package, it was not, it was delivered to a totally incorrect address. The cake was ordered for a 30th which was supposed to be celebrated on the 30th of July. Instead, we had no cake as planned and the cake then sat in a warehouse overnight (incorrect delivery address). The sellers customer service would take no accountability for this and decided as Dpd had sent them ‘proof’ of delivery it was no longer their problem. If you get your baked good where and when your supposed to great, but don’t hope for great customer service as you won’t get it.",Date of experience: 01 July 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,01-Jul-22,This was delivered to the address requested and proof has been sent.,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

When the cake arrived he found they had sent the Lindt chocolate cake instead.  He contacted them immediately and they said they had apparently tried to call but did not leave a message or send an email to say the Biscoff was out of stock and thought they would just send the Lindt one instead! His partner does not like Lindt and he therefore asked them to send another cake and take the other back, they would not take the cake back he had to send it back apparently before they would send another as a replacement. Her birthday party is today! I also contacted the company to ask them to just send another cake, they were completely unapologetic about not notifying him properly (sending a text or email) or for having the cake available to purchase on line in the first place.

We ordered a cake for a birthday party two weeks in advance.

When we requested a callback to sort this quicker over the phone, we were then told that they only correspond over emails. Utter lies and nonsense.

We were then told we would have to return the cake at cost to ourselves and there is no pick up option!!!!!

Cake apparently lost in transit - no refund offered - replacement arrived after the party.
Save your money and guarantee a celebration cake and go to a local supplier.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Update: despite the business suggesting an error on my part, I have their email correspondence confirming the order for the Friday, an email saying ‘it’s lost in transit’ and will be delivered by the due date e.g. the Friday so this confirms exactly the type of business they are!
Thou doth protest too much!
Evidence if ever it was needed - oops! Hate to be told I’m a liar!

6 reviews,Annabel,GB,Updated 8 May 2022,A disappointing experience.,"I ordered a Red Velvet and Cookies and Cream Cake for my daughters Birthday. It arrived on time and was very well packaged and in one piece despite DPD carrying it up the drive on its side, hence two stars as things went downhill from there.
The outer packaging was an enormous box, inside was another polystyrene box, inside that was another quite decorative box of a good size. Upon opening this box we were most disappointed to find a small cake held in position by corrugated cardboard.
The decoration was not as it appeared in the picture which showed Oreo and Chocolate cookies, there were only Oreo cookies. On cutting the cake the inside was not as it appeared in the picture either, it was supposed to be chocolate cake top and bottom layer with a red velvet layer in the middle, it was all red velvet.
We weighed the cake we couldn't believe it weighed 2000g as stipulated online, it did not, it weighed in at 1432g, quite a big difference.
The cake itself was firm and craggy without much flavour and the icing was quite sickly.
I wouldn't recommend this company to any of my friends and have experienced much better quality elsewhere and better value for money.
A most disappointing experience.",Date of experience: 08 May 2022,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,09-May-22,"Very shocked to see this review, our items are hand made and can not weigh the same every single time.

Echoing previous reviews below. I could write a long review but it’s just a repeat of wrong cake sent, appalling customer service, rude, arrogant, passive aggressive.

I did advise Martin I was going to to a charge back through the bank. But I will take action in other ways ….

I think Martin may also be a pseudonym for the 2 brothers … who Martin claims is the manager.

Not wasting anymore time of effort on this.

Spoilt my husbands 50th birthday. Wrong cake. DPD delivered upside down - non of which are Martins problem apparently

EDIT - This has been refuted as a genuine sale by Deserts Delivered Bakery. I have provided proof to Trust Pilot to verify my experience with them.

This was most DEFINITELY NOT refunded.

I am also making my way through NHS Trust colleague sites to inform them of this horrendous service.

1 review,Ab,GB,24-Apr-22,PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"I want to start off by saying that this company and the way they handle things is ABYSMAL! I ordered a Biscoff cake two weeks prior to needing it, less than 24 hours prior to the date of delivery I missed a call from them saying they had supply issues and I needed to phone back to arrange an alternative… these things happen so a few hours later I phoned them back where I was informed everything was okay and it had been sorted- NEVER informed that an alternative was being sent, so I assumed that I was still receiving my cake that I ordered.
The delivery date arrives and the cake arrives… on the box clearly labelled Biscoff cake. Once opened this cake was not a Biscoff cake, and in fact a Lindt Chocolate cake. This was no use to me as the recipient that I got this cake for doesn’t eat chocolate.
I was quickly on the phone and email in attempt to sort this issue out. No one helped, no one even tried to accommodate or apologise. Martin who is a part of ‘customer service’ and looking at previous reviews seems to be the only person who responds to emails. He is rude, patronising and threatened me over a review I hadn’t even written… he threatened me to take the review down or I wouldn’t see any of my refund, not that I was going to see it anyway. They refuse to refund you for their error, they lie and deceive to you and breach their own terms and conditions. It states they inform you of an alternative if it needs to be sent, but they don’t.
I still haven’t received a refund and I don’t think I will ever get my money back…
I have had to seek legal action in order to retrieve my money.
And finally before they comment like they do on every other review… this isn’t fake unlike their ‘positive’ reviews as you will see every negative review on here has been verified to show they are legit and real. I suggest to anyone they read ALL reviews before purchasing as every negative review is the same in regards to this ‘bakery’…",Date of experience: 23 April 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,24-Apr-22,This is a complete lie and we have no recollection of this order or name,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

I was never looking to have a cake to be collected on Good Friday!! Desserts said they would send cake on Thursday, so it would be here on Friday!! Then they cancelled that order too!!

==============

I have used this company for 1 year, I have ordered lots of family and friends Birthday cakes. Never had a problem with them until last week (13 April 2022).

I received an email on 13 April stating they had a system error and my cake would need to be sent earlier due to Easter Holidays. The email stated my delivery date was for Saturday 16 April, which is wrong. My delivery date was for Tuesday 19 April. I replied to the email, asking about the delivery date, to which the reply was ""Thats why we are emailing you as the system took the order in error"". I replied
all they needed to say is they are on public holiday Friday and Monday. I then agreed to my cake being delivered on Friday 15 April.

I thought all was sorted out until I received another email at 12.50am (Thursday morning) that my order was now cancelled and full refund given.

Customer Service was neither helpful or professional in regards to this matter.

Needless to say I managed to source a cake elsewhere who were extremely helpful and managed to get my cake to me on Friday.",Date of experience: 18 April 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,18-Apr-22,Unfortunately no couriers in the UK collect on Good Friday.

I was so disappointed because it was supposed to be for a birthday. I specifically ordered way in advance to give them every chance to have it delivered on time. Would not shop with them again and based my experience, would not recommend them.

4 reviews,Yorkie B,GB,Updated 28 Mar 2022,Unlike Advertised Cake Quality,"Decoration quality was poor, and did not have a professional finish. Did not look like the picture advertised online. The side frosting was not smooth or continuous. The chocolate drizzle was minimal. There were elements of the decoration just not there as advertised. It looked as if it had been decorated by a complete amateur, and as if the online cake was just someone else's entirely.  I'd purchased the Nutella cake for my son's 18th. So if course it was a big disappointment  The taste was nice enough, maybe a touch sweet on the butter cream side. Customer service was poor. Blamed it on transit. However a positive was that it arrived very well packaged and on time. I mentioned this but was told to send it back at my own expense or met with an offer of 50% off a future order. I will not be making a future order!... Cake has a shelf life. It's not feasible to return. So this customer service is therefore unsatisfactory, and my purchase was just not a professional product. If only you could see the photos on here!

3 reviews,Richard Johnson,GB,Updated 22 Mar 2022,DO NOT USE THIS BAKERY,"Firstly - read the other negative reviews - there is a pattern of behaviour with this business sending out inferior/replacement products and expecting the customer to roll over and accept them and when you want a refund the ‘lovely’ Martin is more than happy not to help.

Simply put DO NOT use this bakery and seek an alternative - i ordered a cookie dough cheesecake for my wife's birthday what turned up were 6 individual oreo cheesecakes. I phoned the company on several occasions to arrange a return - no one would take my call to discuss the issue. I have since been in touch with the bakery via email - the best they can do is an ‘arsey’ apology for messing up my wife's birthday cake and an offer to refund the difference between the 2 products. I am currently discussing ‘legally’ my position with their terms and condition's (have a read before you order!) - but likely i will need to take the issue to the small claims court for a full refund.

Update - still not received any monies back from the company. DO NOT TRUST THEM!

Update 2 - They have finally refunded the difference between the cakes i didn't order and cake I ordered. Now they are asking me to return the cakes i didn't order at my expense a week after receiving them for a full refund. You couldn't make it up - AVOID THIS BAKERY AT ALL COSTS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Update 3/reply - So everyone is clear on the sales/returns policy at this bakery - there are some items they don't always stock - fine all companies from time to time will stock out - this company will then take it upon themselves to replace the item without consultation with a ‘most equivalent’ (their wording in the T&C’s) - the item they replaced it with on this occasion was not a cake but 6 individual puddings (not the ‘most equivalent’ in my opinion) - they will then ship this apparently ‘most equivalent’ replacement cake(s) to you - I tried to contact them via phone to make a return and they didn't call me back - I then emailed the business as no luck on the phone - they then mentioned i would have to return the perishable items i didn't order at MY EXPENSE 5 days after i first tried to get in touch - just be clear on this point - YOU will need to pay for a return for a cake you didn’t order. PATHETIC. AVOID. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I’ve stated a refund should be given first as it was a fault on their behalf. Not a broken biscuit. A completely wrong order. Not even a different cupcake. A completely different form of dessert.
They haven’t replied since.

February 16th and the company are trying to blackmail me. They will not give me my refund and have said they will only give me a 50% refund if I remove my trustpilot review. Their product is still sitting untouched but they want me to pay £10 to return it to them.

13 reviews,Mr Allaker,GB,Updated 18 Jan 2022,DONT USE,"We ordered a box of six mini cakes before Christmas. When they arrived, they looked great. We defrosted and tried three of them. Tasteless mush. Contacted their so called customer services and received a reply from Martin (customer service manager). Requested that we would like to return the three uneaten ones. Told that we couldn’t. Tried various suggestions to resolve the issue but according to Martin, you can only deal with him as he is the manager and nobody above him. Asked for details of manager / ceo / legal team and basically got nowhere. Then got told to contact the legal team at the same location as Martin, we know where that was going. Nothing heard back.

Basically, if you like the cakes, great, but if not, throw them in the bin as the customer service is rubbish. Sadly would have preferred to resolve the matter amicably but not with Martin at the helm.

And no, we did not order a cake slice box. Clearly their customer service is a bit to be desired.

It arrived in good time, well packaged and chilled for next day. We had ordered a Victoria sponge rainbow cake which wasn´t available so a chocolate rainbow cake was supplied. I missed a communication about this so was initially disappointed but it was a great success and I would recommend this service to anyone.

4 reviews,Mary Robinson,GB,01-Jan-22,"NICE CAKE, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE","I found myself without a cake for my sons 21st birthday. I looked online & found Desserts Delivered Bakery which promised next day delivery. Their website indicates that if you order before 2pm, you will receive your delivery within 24 hours. I ordered in the morning, so expected by the latest, lunchtime the next day. In time for my sons birthday lunch.
The next day I received an email from DPS stating that my cake would not be delivered until 6.30 pm. Too late for my sons birthday meal & well outside the ‘24 hour’ promise.
The first red flag when trying to rectify this problem, was there was no phone number for customer services. The only way to complain was via email. The second red flag was the contact I had with a ‘customer service’ advisor. He stated that they do not guarantee delivery within 24 hours & then said ‘you won’t get a refund’ - before I had even asked for one!! They were immediately very defensive & certainly were NOT customer focused.
The message to potential customers is, if you are in no hurry, then once received, the cake is nice! But the company clarified that they will never offer an express delivery service. The delivery will always be sent to DPS as a standard delivery, so when you get your delivery is very much dependant on where you are on the DPS schedule.
I would also say that if there are any problems with what you have ordered, the customer service they offer is very poor. The expectation I would suggest is that the company will try to avoid recompense as much as possible.
In summary, if there are no time constraints & the product is ok, you will be fine. Otherwise, you may have a problem.
I will not use them again myself.",Date of experience: 01 January 2022,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,03-Jan-22,"We do not guarantee a delivery time only a delivery date, your cake was delivered on the exact date picked as promised by our website. Thankyou",Desserts Delivered Bakery,4
9 reviews,Sohail,GB,Updated 12 Jan 2022,Absolute joke of a business with no…,"Further update to Dessert Delivered comments:

Utter rubbish and I stick with my comments. They resolved via me asking for a refund to Amazon and not by sending me the missing 2 cakes. Mistake? I hope you have a celebration and someone makes this mistake. I am sure you will be ok with the service provided. Anyway, no chance of any further business and hopefully people reading this will also walk away. Your loss for rubbish post sale customer service.

Update:

Even with the below Amazon have refused to post my review. I will be making a complaint to their review team.

Original post:

Absolute joke of a business with no awareness of customer service. Bought 3 cakes for Christmas and only had 1 delivered. Chase numerous times with no real resolution. Got a message today saying as they delivered 1 cake they will be calling collections company for the money? I have spent thousands with Amazon and always pay what I should. This threatening behaviour is unacceptable and all they needed to do was apologise for messing up my Christmas which they did not care about and I will pay for the useless cake they sent me, which I did. They have not customer service nor any remorse about ruining events they have committed to supply for. A disgrace of service and I have made a formal complaint with Amazon. Keep away. Cake wasn’t great either",Date of experience: 26 December 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,12-Jan-22,You ordered and received the cakes you asked for - we made a mistake and sent one instead of 3 but this was later resolved,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

16 reviews,Deborah Fields,GB,Updated 14 Dec 2021,AVOID!,"Got the cake this morning, WAAAAY smaller than expected and a broken biscuit on the top which is a major part of the presentation.

Their offer was buy a pack of Oreos, we will pay, but not for my time and I am working (hence I ordered and paid more for ease) I am not free to sort this out. Petty for sure but wow they got rude and aggressive fast.

They said send it back, leaving me with no birthday cake.

Like the other reviews, they tried bribery to take this down, so clearly a habit, along side them then making a complaint saying this wasn’t so to trust pilot so I had to prove I was a client. Which I clearly could.

meh, avoid as with the slightest issue they are rude and aggressive.

They’ve also lied in their response here. I have emails that trust pilot have seen and verified so again, they offered a bribe in a half refund and wouldn’t do so until I removed this. Yay it’s now verified. So proves my experience. I may even go to citizens advice or small claims.

The broken biscuit couldn’t be removed as it was kind of melted in and ruined the look and the outside had cream missing (like a smudged look)

I’m getting sarcasm. It was expensive to save hassle. The presentation was damaged by bad packing. It wasn’t layered as promised, it was just red velvet. It was bland and sugar. One slice was tasted and it was thrown. It didn’t look like the picture.

It was easy to place my order on the website. Once placed, I was advised that the order would be made just before it was shipped and that I didn't have to do anything else. Perfect.

The cake arrived at around 12pm today in the most secure and failsafe box I have ever seen for a cake. I was so impressed how well protected it was. There was even dry ice in the box to keep the cake frozen.

The courier they used (DPD) gave regular updates on the delivery, so it was easy to make sure we were at home and ready for the delivery. Also, it was great that the cake was delivered on the day I wanted.

The cake itself looks exactly like the picture and I got exactly what I paid for, very impressed. We haven't had chance to taste it yet, but it looks so delicious. The leaflet advises to wait 2-3 hours before eating, to ensure its fully defrosted. I will update here when we have tried it, but I suspect its going to taste amazing!

1 review,Lauren Southwell,GB,08-Nov-21,Could not recommend this company to anyone.,"I ordered a cake and some cheesecakes from this company on November 3rd for my boyfriends 30th Birthday, the items looked great on the website and I choose the Kinder Hazelnut cake specifically as I knew this was a cake he would love.

Unfortunately when the item was delivered on the Saturday I discovered that the incorrect cake had been delivered and I have received a Lotus Biscoff cake instead. I emailed the company straight away with a photo explaining the situation and when I was responded to I was told that it looked like a food packer had made an error and would I like to accept this cake. I explained that I would not like to accept this cake as my boyfriend who's birthday the cake was for does not like Biscoff and so it would be wasted. I also explained that we had kept the packaging and not opened the cake in order to return it for the correct cake.

Following this the company agreed for the cake to be returned to them for a replacement of the correct item however when I asked for clarification as to if they would be paying the shipping cost to send this back I was told that this would be my responsibility even though they had admitted to the fault being theirs.

This has now been going back and forth for the past two days with the manager on duty telling me that they do not pay for returns as stated in their terms and conditions. However I pointed out several times that this is not a return and is in fact a complaint due to their error and was still met with we do not pay for returns.

I also received an email pointing out a condition on their website about if an item is out of stock they will contact me and replace it with an equivalent cake. However when I queried why this was relevant as they had already said it was an employee error, I was told why it was relevant or sent to me.

I was also offered a 50% refund and to keep the wrong cake however as I had already explained, this cake is not suitable and would instead be going to waste.

I have now been in touch with Citizens Advice and have sent a formal letter of complaint citing my legal rights in terms of my short term right to reject and their options to either had the incorrect item picked up or to reimburse postal costs as a consequential loss to myself attached to an email to which they have responded ""We have already replied to the email you don't need to send us the letter.""

Unfortunately I feel that my complaint is not going to be resolved by this company and I will not be receiving the refund to which i am entitled unless I go further to trading standards or through my bank.

I'm honestly so disappointed as the cheesecake selection we also received look incredible however this experience has definitely put me off ever ordering from or recommending this company in the future.",Date of experience: 08 November 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,08-Nov-21,"We have offered a full refund or the correct product sent out

1 review,FM Neruda,GB,05-Nov-21,BUYER BEWARE!,"This one is quite straightforward:

I bought a Carrot Cake and a Cookie Dough Cheesecake. The weight for each item is listed at approximately 2000g (i.e. 2Kg) on the website.

When I received the items it was obvious that they were much smaller so I weighed them on my kitchen scale...

The Cheesecake was 1548g and the Carrot Cake came in at just... 920g!!!!!!!!! That's less than half the advertised weight. Sure, I get the fact that it's an approximated weight on the website but the Carrot Cake is less than half the listed weight, which is ridiculous in my opinion.

I immediately contacted Desserts Delivered who did not take any responsibility and said they consider it's good value for the price. Now... value is of course subjective but weight clearly is not so I'm writing this review just so everyone is aware of these massive weight discrepancies.

In the interest of fairness I will say that the products were delivered on time, the packaging is excellent and they are high quality indeed but I'm not a fan of false advertising and lack of ownership on the company's part for what is clearly a BIG ISSUE!

Hope this is useful to any future buyers",Date of experience: 05 November 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,10-Nov-21,"It clearly explains that the measurements are ""approximate"" We hand make all of our products so it is impossible to know the exact measurements.

When I opened it the packaging was still ice cold and extremely well protected so the cake was perfect.

I allowed it to come to room temperature before we sliced and I have to say I was a little dubious, I've never eaten a cake before that had been frozen but I need not have worried, it defrosted really well, everything stayed in place and the cake still looked incredible and it was absolutely delicious!

The cake I had was cookies and cream, it was a really light and moist chocolate sponge covered in a really delicious buttercream, chocolate and cookies on top.

What will you do re-freeze it and resell it ? - absolute joke ! . All I ever asked for was £15 and reading some of these reviews you would most likely claim the returned ruined cake never arrived. Enjoy my money and thanks for spoiling a birthday.EDIT 2: Gobsmacked to say the least , latest email from company saying they will refund once I take this review down. Still waiting.  Last message very unsavioury and I quote from their Manager on duty Tony Misham  "" Hi James - No problem we will do once the review is removed, i have a sales rep in your area are you home today and we can discuss, We do not appreciate slander of our business online.

If you read this , please process what you have agreed back to me. I have also verified this review with Trust Pilot since you have disputed it !! Unbelievable tactics.This Company leaves me no choice but to leave this review. Having read others it seems I am not the first. Firstly cake arrived fine on the day but was missing the ordered candles. Furthermore on opening,  the cake was damaged. Not one to want to fuss I contacted the company and was told to check the box again (I had of course 3 times) and also send an image of the damage. Oddly after 5 attempts to email the damaged cake , each of my emails was blocked by their servers even by sending to more than one of their email addresses and using more than one of mine. Coincidence ?  By this point of being completely frustrated , I opened a Paypal dispute (to be fair to the company the cake with shipping cost £41.99 , I asked for a £15 refund for damage and missing items which I think is very reasonable . This was then met with a response to return the cake and items (candles missing - of course invisible candles can't be returned can they) for my £15 refund and at my postage expense , really - are you for real ? £15 refund, no cake, no candles for a £41.99 outlay that spoilt my sons birthday and I can also add the cake biscuits are soggy and stale just to add insult to injury . I gave an olive branch to this Company and was met with every obstructive twist and turn and now silence.  The worst customer service I have experienced.

37 reviews,Lisa-Marie Platt,GB,Updated 14 Sept 2021,"Lovely looking cakes, but check the best before date !!","I ordered the deluxe chocolate hazelnut cake and I was not disappointed. Delivery 27/08/2021 as I requested but would happily of had a day earlier if need be. The cake arrived in a robust packaging and in perfect condition. I also ordered some gluten free cakes which come in a separate package.
I was apprehensive after reading some negative reviews, everyone has their own story to tell but I am so glad I gave it a go.
Only down side is I wish they did a gluten free birthday cake but the individual cakes look delicious.??


So after I have given a glowing review I opened the vegan gluten free assorted cakes which 2 had been eaten to put the other cakes into a storage container these were not a gift thankfully to find they had a best before date 16/07/2021 these were delivered to me on 27th August 2021 some 6 weeks after the best before date, I have contacted the company via their website today and awaiting a reply and an explanation to why and how this happened, I could do nothing about the 2 cakes I had eaten but the other 4 went into the bin.
So at present no I would not recommend or buy again will update once the company has responded.

Update: After writing this review and several emails with the company nothing short of blackmail, I take my review down I get a refund for the 6 weeks out of date cakes they sent me, they then went the extra mile to contact trustpilot claiming I was not a customer! Which I had to prove to trust pilot and send evidence of my purchase, this review has been verified and yes unfortunately I was a customer and not a happy one.

I will be happy to add correspondence emails bargaining off me taking down this review in order to receive a refund for the out of date goods sent, and also proof of my order and delivery date and the best before date being 6 weeks after my delivery, if you are selling out of date goods the consumer must be made aware of this prior to purchase which I was not. Clearly not a lie or fake review as verified by trustpilot",Date of experience: 27 August 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,13-Sep-21,"This review is a complete lie, we make our products then freeze and dispatch therefore a sell by date is not required until the cake is sent.

1 review,Julie Thompson,GB,Updated 4 Nov 2021,Terrible company,"Received a cake I didn’t order had to use it as this company don’t bother replying to customers, they promise replies to customers problems within 5 hours I waited 4 days didn’t get an apology weirdly asked me to return this 4 day old cake at my expense for their error in order to get a refund! This negatively impacted my daughters 21st celebrations and this company couldn’t even apologise. The cake itself was white chocolate which I would never choose cut a few slices for people and threw the rest away waste of money don’t use these people if you’re buying for a special occasion as they make mistakes don’t apologise horrible company. Disgraceful Didn’t get a refund as they refuse refunds unless you remove your review which means they only have good reviews giving a fake impression of how they operate.

6 reviews,Nori,GB,08-Jul-21,Extremely shocking company very very…,"Extremely shocking company very very disappointed I want to start off by saying that the cake that was ordered it was a completely different cake to the one that actually showed up completely different colour different ingredient different decorations that was the first problem the second problem is that cake actually arrived with a note on top explaining that they tried to contact me and the cake that I ordered was out of stock.. That was not true in fact that was a complete fabrication nobody contact me I didn't have any emails or missed calls to explain that the cake I ordered was not in stock and that they would be delivering me a completely different one.
The customer service for this company is even more shocking than the cake that arrived it was an orange cake with more icing than cake it actually tastes a little bit like orange bubble gum and left a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards I had to get rid of this and get another cake as it was my son's birthday the day the cake came and they sent me a cake for a little girl that was leaning too one side because the sponge was struggling to manage with the weight of cream in between the layers there was sprinkles all over the box and cream all over the plastic bag that they cover the cake with.
I had to make a complaint to consumer services about the lack of professionalism within this company and the fact that they refused to give your money back.
They refused to give you a refund even after you have to prove to them that they sent the wrong cake. After acknowledging that they sent you the wrong cake after you have to provide them with picture evidence they are even more unreasonable when trying to sort out an issue and will do anything to not give you your refund.
This is actually the second review that I've had to write on this company because they told trustpilot that my review wasn't real.
I feel as though that as a company you really should let your customers know if you do not have an item in stock and that you're going to send them out a completely different cake as they refuse refunds.
They Should also learn how to speak to people with compassion and Honesty as you can't run a company off of lies and bad cake! They need ro accept when there the the wrong and try and resolve the issue instead of making customers frustrated and disappointed and making the situation worse, after seeing all the other reviews I realise that this is just how they conduct their business.
I've had to make a complaint to consumers services in regards to this matter I've never had to go to any extremes with any company before and to be honest I wouldn't have if a customer service didn't treat customers as they do.
The experience of the using this company was shocking.
I was told by the customer service man that I will not get my money back unless I take down my review, so as you can guess I'm still waiting for it. So I suggest if anybody wants to make a review on this company to write it after you receive your full refund otherwise you will not received your money or a replacement.
Personally I don't think anyone should be treated this way and I would never use this company again if I could give them -5 stars I would but unfortunately the minimum you can give them is one",Date of experience: 08 July 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,,,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

2 reviews,Laura Stuart,GB,Updated 4 Jul 2021,Wrong cake,"I ordered a white chocolate lint cake for my partners 30th. The cake arrived and it was a chocolate deluxe cake.
The cake was also not packaged properly as I have ordered before from the company. It was in a cardboard box - no polystyrene as usually does and the cake has fell to one side.
I contacted the company to highlight the wrong cake had been sent and if they could send out the correct cake for the following day as they offer next day delivery.
The company would not be able to send the correct cake out until 3 days later (this was two days after the occasion) and would not be able to offer a refund in full even though the item that arrived was not what I ordered.
I was told I had to return the wrong, damaged cake that arrived to the company to get a refund in full. I was not prepared to go to the inconvenience of sending a cake back when the fault was not on my part. Also why would the company want the cake returned? Are they going to sell this cake on again? I would not be happy receiving a second hand cake!
When I said this is disappointing not to get a full refund the company told me ‘we are a business we can’t just send out free cakes’
I was not looking for a free cake - I wanted the correct cake or refund in full.
The company offered a £10 refund from £43 total (including delivery) and did not offer to refund delivery costs until questioned. They could not offer a full refund as I was told ‘the cake costs £20 to make’

2 reviews,Clare Sieber,GB,Updated 13 Jul 2021,terrible. wrong cake sent. refund was not easy to get,"terrible - look at the reviews carefully as you'll see my experience is very common.

I'm sure the company will claim this is a 'fake' review, but this review will stay up on the site as trust pilot will verify the order from the emails and the paypal receipts.

Ordered a cake for my daughter's birthday. They sent the wrong one. When I complained they asked me to return it (a defrosted cake??!!), no details of how to return it. Obviously I said no, unlike the poor person in the review below who went to all the effort to return it only for them to claim it was never received.

They then tried to convince me to accept a discount and 'keep' the wrong cake. Obviously I refused. In their third email they then admitted that they didn't have the cake in stock when I ordered it, so they had just sent me another cake without informing me. They said it was the same/similar inside, but I'd ordered a rainbow cake and this was a chocolate cake.

When I emailed for the fourth time demanding a refund, I said I would submit a paypal claim and leave a negative review on this site if they didn't refund me in full. Lo and behold they immediately agreed to refund and 'let me keep' the wrong cake.

Of course I had to chase the refund.

Order at your peril, and if you do, make sure you use paypal so you can get your money back quickly!

1 review,ZM,GB,Updated 29 Jun 2021,Worst customer service! Staff is rude and passive aggressive even when they turn out to be wrong in the end ??,"Awful. As a business graduate, this shop’s customer service is absolutely appalling. They refuse to refund even when you have provided proof that you returned their cake WHICH ARRIVED AFTER THE BIRTHDAY (selected date delivery my ass). It took a whole month to convince them that the cake has been returned AND IT HAS, it took finding and bugging the courier, asking for the name of the person who received etc. for them to acknowledge that I’m not lying about returning their damn late cake. Even though I sent them the tracking info of the return, clearly stating delivered. The problem was they clearly didn’t track what arrives back/what gets returned to them and who receives it. Instead, they kept insisting that they did not receive any returns, when they clearly did seeing as the courier said a certain (name) received it- which they later confirmed works for them. A WHOLE MONTH of back and forth bs before my refund. What kind of customer service emails you back SO rude as well? And just see for yourself, the way they reply to 1 star reviews here. No accountability, absolutely passive aggressive when dealing with unsatisfied customers. Customers are either delighted or not, if they’re not, you don’t behave passive aggressively but instead take their feedback into consideration. Yikes. Your management needs a lot of improvement especially whoever handles customer reviews and complaints because they need to be trained or fired. And for the love of god, record what comes in and out of your store. Even if the cake was delightful (which I don’t know because it didn’t arrive on time), I still wouldn’t bother with this shop due to their awful customer service.


EDIT: following your reply that this is a fake review, nope. This is my order number 77089. I can confirm that you have already refunded me so me leaving this review isn’t to acquire refund from you because I already got it. I’m only sharing my experience here because it truly was awful. It took a month and countless email exchanges for you to refund me because you didn’t believe that I returned that cake despite me providing the tracking info saying it’s successfully delivered back to you. You wouldn’t refund until cornered w the name of the recipient of the cake who is your employee. It’s just not fair to be treated that way when it’s your fault for not recording what gets returned to you and who received it. That’s it. I’m not here to discuss further, I’m just sharing my experience and I’ve seen other reviewers saying you’re asking them to take down their negative review. I’m saying now I won’t do that, so do not bother to coerce.",Date of experience: 29 June 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,,"So sorry you did not receive your cake, if you did we are 100% sure this review would not apply.

1 review,Creative vinyl,GB,06-May-21,Lucky to get a star,"Lucky to get a star, if I could give none I would. I purchased a birthday cake for my daughter, it arrived, it was a chocolate orange cake. It was absolutely vile, even the children wouldn’t eat it, the fake cream that made up 50% of the cake was revolting had a horrible bitter aftertaste, ruined my daughters special day.
I have told everyone I know and told them to inform everyone they know not to touch this company, they are all about the money, customer service is non existent, they talk down to you and accuse us the customers of wrong doing or being stupid.",Date of experience: 06 May 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,07-May-21,"Clearly a fake review, Our 4.5 star rating and customer reviews speak for themselves.

4 reviews,of Debbiejp,GB,Updated 5 May 2021,Extremely disappointing experience,"Extremely disappointing experience. I paid for next day delivery but cakes did not arrive until a day late. I asked for a refund of the next day delivery cost but was told they cannot do this and blamed the pandemic?! I pointed out that we have lived with the pandemic for over a year and if they cannot fulfil their next day delivery promise then they should not advertise this as an option and should not keep payment taken under false pretences. After numerous emails culminating in my expressing disappointment at their awful customer service and pointing out that they could have issued repayment of the delivery cost, or offered a discount on a future order, or indeed free delivery, and that their failure to make any effort to make amends leaves me with the only option but to order elsewhere in the future,  they told me that if I order again in the future “let me know and I will refund some money back as a good will”. Sorry too little too late. The cakes I had ordered for a birthday gift were vegan brownies, they came with no explanation as to what each brownie was. I pointed this out but they have never addressed the point. To brownies were ok but nothing special. Suffice to say I won’t be ordering from this company again.UPDATE.  Your response to this review is not true. You said “Hi Debbie, we do make customers aware online to order a day or two before needed due to the covid 19 situation, and will unable to refund delivery costs as the moment”. You did not offer me a refund. I asked for one and you did not refund me. It does not say to order a day or two before on your website. What you actually say is order before 2 for next day delivery.  I have the emails and I only wish I were able to add them or a screenshot to my review.

My cake arrived on time , unfortunately it didn’t look like the picture on website, there was no chocolate running down one side so you could see the layers of cake , my chocolate balls were cracked or had chocolate missing , there was very little or no nuts at the bottom of the cake , so I had to redecorate it !! And as for the box it had coloured sprinkles stuck in it ( my cake was nuts ) looks like a reused box . I complained by email and was told I would get part of my money back after a week and lots of emails , I decided to do a review , they then asked me to take review down and then they would send refund ,which I did, I have received my refund and I have reported them to consumer services and I hope everyone else who has had problems with them does too , they took my review off this site and I contacted trust pilot and sent proof of purchase and emails , and trust pilot verified it , This is NOT a professional company!",Date of experience: 02 May 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03-May-21,"Our cakes are made fresh daily, we have never re used a box, we have a 5 star rating with trading standards and work closely with trading standards to ensure our quality is excellent.

* update 21/04/21
This has not been resolved no replacement cake was received, no refund. We did however get a bribe email ‘take down review and we will refund’

Not bad for review they have tried to tell trust pilot it’s fake, keep all your correspondence from this childish petty company and be warned your complaints will not be dealt with.

Bad customer service
Again it comes to customer service, ordered the white chocolate Lindt Lindor cake, when cake was delivered there was a note to say they had sold out so they sent a replacement.

This was for my daughter who was looking forward to her cake and o know she will be bitterly disappointed with this rainbow cake shes 28 not 10.

Emailed to say this response was a hollow apology and they had tried to phone several times (lie) they called once and I was at work if they had sent an email I would have been able to respond ?????

I would like to send this cake back and get a full refund! This is my second complaint there customer service never offers solutions just blunt emails! Nice cakes is not enough to build a company your customer service will in the end bring you down!

Update, after posting a review which was removed (due to them saying it was fake ??) ?? I was contacted and an apology was made with a promise of a new cake to be sent which has yet to materialise. Rubbish customer service, hollow apologies and false promises, way to go you’ve nailed poor customer service.

Surely to save issues you need to make sure your stock levels are accurately reflected to avoid orders of out of stock products and disappointied customers (these are the people that keep your business running ?????)

The order process is simple, you choose the day you want it delivering. The hard part is picking which flavour you want.
I was really nervous and excited once the email notification arrived saying dispatched.
But I had nothing to worry about. This company have obviously researched a lot how to get your bake to you safely.
The packing is much more than I was expecting and I also now have a handy cool box for the summer BBQ’s.
The cake itself was one of the best cakes I have ever had. The sponge was light and moist, the icing smooth, I can not fault it at all.

8 reviews,Karen Howard,GB,Updated 17 Feb 2021,Was trying to help,"Ordered a biscoff cake for my husbands birthday - delivered frozen solid (know the website states they are frozen but this was extreme and even had ice crystals on).. after 10hrs (gone 9pm at night) i felt whilst still exceptionally cold, his birthday would be over if we didn’t give my husband his birthday cake so we did..
I’d stress the cake itself is beautiful and we had high hopes but when we cut in it fell apart and crumbled in large chunks - it was also exceptionally dry but i believe this was due to how deeply frozen it was.
I dropped the company a message, not because i wanted anything (quite the opposite) but merely as I felt for the sake of their own business, they should see what was being delivered as maybe had a courier issue. I also volunteered to return it for them to see for themselves but received back quite a sharp reply (below). To be honest I’m now posting on here because maybe I’m not the only one who has experienced this and they should know. I was shocked that they clearly don’t like being given feedback to try and help their own business, which was all I was trying to do.
Sadly after this type of reply I won’t be ordering again despite having be prepared to before the response.

Reply - “Hi Karen, it is clearly stated online that our cakes are sent frozen so they are not damaged in transit, the cake is perfect to eat and we sold over 1000 of this flavour this week with no complaints, The cake requires defrosting for around 2-3 hours and it is perfect to eat, sorry you were not impressed like most of our customers”

Edit - I’m guessing from the identical response they have sent to my trust pilot review that is almost word for word what they they emailed me and I already quoted on this review, what i have experienced actually happens quite often, hence such a standard word for word response! Maybe in future they should read and learn from what customers are saying as I don’t see how a crystallised cake is perfect ..

Updated 17/01 - this company has now flagged my post to trustpilot as being ungenuine - considering they responded to me hours before I posted on trustpilot (and I did because of their shoddy response) they know full well it’s genuine. I’m shocked and gobsmacked an email sent to them out of concern for their products and how they are delivered has been met with such shocking customer service and then they have the audacity to say I’m not even a genuine customer - All I can say is avoid them at all costs",Date of experience: 14 February 2021,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,14-Feb-21,"Hi Karen, it is clearly stated online that our cakes are sent frozen so they are not damaged in transit, the cake is perfect to eat , The cake requires defrosting for around 2-3 hours and it is perfect to eat, sorry you were not impressed like most of our customers",Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

It wasn’t the cheapest option, but the cakes looked so amazing! I decided to give it a go an so glad I did! I ordered the biscoff cake which arrived on the Friday as requested. My partners birthday wasn’t until the Sunday an when opened it was so fresh! It looked just like it had on the website and tasted moist and perfect! Both the cakes themselves and the the transport are well thought through so you get the cake you order. 100% recommend. It may seem a little pricey but definitely worth it. The cake is so wonderfully rich it definitely does serve a lot of people!",Date of experience: 09 February 2021,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

Hello, I am looking for a rainbow cake for a 5 year old girl's birthday to be delivered on the 13th February in the West Midlands. I can see on your site a chocolate rainbow cake. Is this the only one you do? I don't want anything that is too sickly as per one of the trustpilot reviews. Is this cake just a sponge with rainbow colours with no or very little icing. Also, I note the 6"" one is far too small and wonder whether you do an 8"" or 10"" one. Thank you. p.s. no tel no so I can speak to you.

3 reviews,Rhiannon james,GB,27-Jan-21,Ordered the Biscoff Cake,"I ordered the Biscoff cake for my sisters birthday. The cake arrived on my chosen date despite the snow! The cake was well packaged and arrived exactly as seen on the website. The cake was smaller than expected, however it does clearly state on the website that the cakes are 6"", I am just rubbish with measurements. Although smaller than initially expected, what I will say is that a small amount of cake goes an incredibly long way as the cake, although incredibly tasty, was very rich and a little sickly (which is a good thing for me as I have an incredibly sweet tooth!). About 1/3 of the cake comfortably fed 5 of us so it would definitely provide 10 generous portions as specified on the website! Overall it was a good shopping experience and I will likely order again for small family events/birthdays.

Had every hope it would arrive on time (next day delivery is the promise) but did not mind if it was a day late. Got an email from the appointed delivery company on 19th saying it would be delivered the next day - great! When nothing had arrived by 21st I messaged Desserts Delivered but received no response. As the day passed by I messaged again and on 22nd I received a very functional email response (‘sorry for the delay’ ‘it will be delivered as soon as possible’’). This is is not good enough as my order was for a birthday cake and I specified a delivery date. It is the 24th today and nothing has arrived - and as the moment has passed the cake would not be meaningful - I have sadly requested a refund as really wanted the lovely cake shown on the website and did not get it and had to battle for even a sentence of information to let me know what was happening.

51 reviews,BBC Scotland,GB,Updated 14 Feb 2021,ORDER EXPERIENCE,"ORDER EXPERIENCE
Ordered twice in 10 days for 2 friends. I would take one star off for a minor gripe that will go into later but the speed of the response to my query was satisfactory and can be overcome. What's important is the product was delivered timely, efficiently and intact.

Opted for the Brownie Selection box for 2 friends - some lockdown cheer and we can't see them. Nice surprise.

Received on the designated dates - unfortunately no note was included; recipients were perplexed as to who and why brownies are delivered to them! One was a better sleuth than the other :)

One recipient said no dry ice or foam padding, but product intact in box - this was how the product is said to be packaged under delivery.
Mentioning as the person gifting will not necessarily know how the product presents unless friend/ receiver tells the person gifting!

Emailed Desserts Delivered and they were great at responding and explained they don't normally include the invoice- great as I didn't want that; ""not classy"" when a gift but I did want the note :(

INVOICE
""Our products never come with an invoice apart from an email to the purchaser, Like you said as a gift most people do not want the recipient aware of the price paid for the product. ""
NOTES
The reply went on to say the notes are for the company internally. That's fine - there's a solution. If needed we can purchase from their menu under ""Extras"" and choose ""personalised notes"" - just looked, it is £4 for this service; high quality paper + envelope.
In my book, perhaps I am being mean, I would only pay this for a ""note"" if a birthday or annniversary.

Especially as we are already paying for the product and delivery. It makes it almost £25 for 6 Brownies if we selected the ""Extra"" for the tailored print out on high quality paper and envelope!

MINOR GRIPE
No note - for the price + delivery, a standard note options at no charge should be available for customers like myself who is not purchasing for their own consumption.

OVERALL
I don't fault the product or the speed of response from the company to the question- therefore will give 4/5 as this is a business and it's only fair as I for one look on TrustPilot before I purchase - if the company have reviews here.

Happy ordering and don't let our minor gripe put you off. At least it is now clear.

* We were told most of their customers include the note option - that's fancy paper and envelope - unfortunately the scrooge in me can't bring myself to part with £4 for the privilege - may as well have my friends sleuth. I am obviously not ""most"".

UPDATE: TRUST PILOT REVIEWS
Just read verified positive and negatives reviews for Desserts Delivered Bakery; comforting that others felt that tone was amiss when querying!
Perhaps, I am being sensitive but this was part of the response in my email from sales manager:

""This is available on the extras section and is included in almost every order we take, Apologies that this was not made clear or you failed to spot this on the website"",

Aim of my review is not to cast doubt on the products but more an experience from the ""gifter"" as opposed to ""recipient"" ,- I doubt the receivers of the gift will look on the website unless they wish to purchase or like me, the friend chose to.tell me.
I would have been horrified if they were too embarrassed to say the present was horrid.

I would urge people to read, the good, the bad and the ugly - then decide.
Having read a range now, I'm slightly put off and not sure I would have ordered, had I spent more time reading the reviews. Especially as it's a happy gift ??.

24/01/21 - just received message from TrustPilot asking for more information from dessertsdeliveredbakery. I am actually not looking for a response as had one when I enquired and I even explained what led to my purchase with them as a company; wish for peace of mind when purchasing - both positive and negative experiences.


I am leaving my review up - not looking for a refund or anything - just voicing my experience which was overall good but will reduce the stars if I feel badgered for voicing an opinion. Thank you Trust Pilot.

14/02/21
Now reduced to 3 stars from 4. Having read more recent reviews, I would be amiss if I mislead anyone into thinking I would recommend or order again.

Having been on other sites, Trustpilot often flags up cos who try and have reviewers remove negative feedback. This company did this with reviewers - wondering why there isn't a pop up...

5 reviews,Scott,GB,Updated 2 Jan 2021,Unreliable & Unprofessional Company,"Never again!
I bought a Rainbow Cake for my wife's birthday, at about 1am on Friday 11th December and paid the delivery charge and the extra charge (which are notified only at checkout) for delivery on Saturday 12th December. The total was £47.75, Order No. 57615. Based on the claim on their website, this should have been delivered within 24 hours, or by 2pm on Saturday the 12th December.
It didn't arrive!
I emailed them and straight away got this response from the Operation s Manager.
""Hi Scott,
Deepest apologies regarding this, we paid DHL £13 to have this delivered today, We will email them but you can also contact them on 02476 937770 quoting: 41776040003411
It does clearly state on two occasions as well as our terms and conditions you legally accepted that due to the current pancdemic and medical supplies being priority there are some slight delays.
Apologies regarding this""

I've never come across a supplier quoting terms and conditions of sale as an apology! Very strange.

The cake eventually arrived at about 5.00pm on Monday 14th and I refused delivery based on the fact it was 2 days late, it had defrosted and wasn't, in my view, fit for consumption..
Since then I was offered a 50% refund which I declined.
The case has now been claimed on PayPal, where a member of their staff stated that I had taken delivery of the cake and eaten it! I asked him for a proof of delivery which he ignored and can't provide, but he has said that if I return the cake he will give a full refund. I'm not sure how I can return it when I never took delivery of it.
No doubt, just as he does on just about every poor review, they will take no responsibility for poor customer service, respond that he can prove the cake was delivered, that it was still edible for 6 days, and find some way to blame me for the cake not turning up on time and not accepting delivery.
I understand that carriers don't always turn up on time, and if he had apologised straight away (on the Sunday), advised that the cake was still edible, offered a part refund, and confirmed when it would be delivered, I probably would have accepted that, but the fact he immediately quoted terms and conditions of sale, left me shaking my head.
This company quite clearly doesn't have a clue about customer service, and their attitude and responses to what is a perfectly legitimate complaint, just begs for a review like this.
Good luck if you do order from this company. Just remember that if your order doesn't turn up on time, it's probably your fault!!

Update 2/1/21- I received this email from Trustpilot yesterday ""Desserts Delivered Bakery has flagged your review because they don't believe you've had a genuine experience with them."" I sent Trustpilot the documentation they required, and you will see at the top left of my review that they have ""verified"" my review.
My review was based not just on the fact that the cake was delivered 2 days late, or that it was completely defrosted and in my opinion not fit for consumption, but on the way they reacted to my complaint. To quote terms and conditions when you get something wrong is not a customer friendly approach in my opinion, and now to argue that ""I didn't have a genuine experience with them"", is bizarre.
Strange company in my opinion and not one I'll ever order from again!

1 review,Alfie,GB,Updated 27 Dec 2020,Avoid at all costs,"Avoid at all costs.

Ordered a cheesecake on 6th December for delivery on the 23rd December. Ordered arrived on the day and it was a completely different cheesecake (Ordered a Ferrero Rocher and received an Oreo one). Of course mistakes happen but what is not a mistake is the baffling, disgusting and most unprofessional customer service I have ever come across.
Upon emailing straight after receiving the cake I had an email straight away to state they tried calling me (no missed calls at all showing suspiciously in the last few months) and that was it. I responded that this was unacceptable and was informed if I wanted a refund I have to send back the product myself. I then informed them that this was their mistake and the cost of me sending the item back would be almost the same price of the actual refund itself. I was emailed a response ""we tried calling and it's in the terms"" I said I would happily accept this if he can prove they had tried calling me and where exactly it stated in the terms if they send an incorrect item the customer is expected to send back the item at their own expense for a refund... Well I haven't received a response since and they had been replying to me instantly until this point.

I thought I'd check online for any help and stumbled across Trustpilots reviews only to see I am not the only one having issues with this horrendous service for a mistake on their part. It looks like they will try at any means to get any bad reviews taken down by commenting on reviews to state the customer is lying or they were never a customer to start with. Luckily I have proof of every email send by them and my order confirmation and photos from delivery to back up everything I have stated in this review if they even attempt to get this taken down. The actual issue of the wrong cheesecake had not bothered me this much but I refuse to let any company treat customers this poorly and unprofessional as this.

All I can advise anyone is proceed with caution when ordering on a customer service point of view as if you experience any issues you will not get any help in the matter.

UPDATE 26/12/20 - First reply on this review stated they had contacted me by email for a full refund but I had not responded. This was a complete lie on there part they had not responded to my previous email from the 23rd, and what turned up 20 minutes later after their first comment below? Their reply to my email which just stated the terms of the refund but just confirmed my problem from the original review. Sadly they have continued the lies stating in their edited comment below they sent me a more expensive replacement. But both items are £30 on their website. They also state below a note was attached and a free item. Again sadly this is a complete lie no other item came with the delivery (happy to prove with photos from delivery) and I have apparently declined a refund but have not even had the chance to reply to there email from 20 minutes ago so I'm not sure where they got that idea from.

9 reviews,A Vijay,GB,23-Dec-20,Thank you for such amazing cakes!,Ordered two cakes for birthday celebrations which we were to enjoy with family members on Christmas day but unfortunately due to the Tier 4 restrictions I had to cancel my order.  Tony @ Deserts was very helpful and refunded my order straight away.  Much to my surprise we received two cakes today and when I contacted Tony he kindly sent them to cheer us up.  So very kind and thoughtful!  With all the craziness going on and not being able to see family at Christmas this was such a kind gesture which really cheered us up!We will definitely be enjoying the cakes !  Thank you so much Tony and team!I have ordered from deserts before and the cakes have always been delicious!  They are well packaged for transportation and enjoyed by all!Thank you again Deserts :0),Date of experience: 23 December 2020,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

5 reviews,Nessar Miah,GB,23-Dec-20,"Beautiful, scrumptious cake delivered perfectly on time","I am really impressed by this company and APC (delivery company). Ordered a cake on Sunday night to be delivered Tuesday. Got an email to say the cake was complete on Monday and then multiple emails from the delivery company updating the journey of the cake. It arrived at 1.30pm on Tuesday by a friendly driver who passed the box over with care.

I ordered the Deluxe Chocolate Hazlenut Truffle Cake. It was very well packaged and easy to take out of the box. The cake was beautiful to look at and tasted fresh, moist and indulgent. The only thing I thought could be improved, is that the Ferroro Rochers weren't as crispy due to being kept at low temperature (obviously to preserve the cake). I'm not sure what could be done, maybe leave them in the foil/case so that moisture doesn't get to them and leave a little note explaining why? But honestly, other than that, the cake was a big hit and I'm looking forward to making more purchases in the future.

14 reviews,James Conway,GB,07-Dec-20,We tried to call,"I pre-ordered a cake at the start of November (order ref #54537) paid via PayPal
A Red Velvet cake to be delivered on the 24th November for my wife’s birthday.
I had an email to state order was received,Had another email to say cake had been dispatched, had a email from A.P.C regarding delivery time and made sure someone was in to receive the cake.
Had an email/text from A.P.C saying my parcel had been delivered.came home and checked the cake and much to my surprise had a note saying,

Hi,
We have tried to call you as we are missing the cake you ordered.we did not get an answer so have replaced it with another.
Apologies for the inconvenience,
Thanks.

Firstly I’ve had no missed calls from desserts delivered and No message left .
I should have been sent an email on the day of dispatch as they say these cakes are made to order on the point of ordering in the first place ?
Sadly no message , email or missed call and I’ve checked my missed calls log on phone and have no missed calls from the dessert delivered bakery, missed call log goes back to October.
So this comment on the note left with the cake I never order which is made to order? Is an out right lie.
If I had been contacted I would have cancelled my order which had been paid for 22 days prior to date needed.
I contacted Desserts delivered bakery via there contact page to tell them no one had called me and that my wife won’t eat this cake,To have a reply of we did call you ?
As they then said they sent me out the one I received instead,If their cakes are made to order who’s cake did I get ,or was it just one that was lying around .
Clearly they are not made to order as these cakes come frozen so must be made in batches and not to individual requirements as mentioned on ones the web page.
This would have been blatantly obvious they didn’t have the Red Velvet in the empty space in the freezer where they normally sit ?.
I’ve had quite a rude exchange of emails from the operations director.who does not care one bit and after saying they don’t organise collections it’s now been left where I will have to pay to send the cake back for a refund which is outrageous in its own right as I never ordered this cake I received.

Even in the face of a pandemic which we are going through,This is not the way to run a business.

Just taking peoples money 22 days in advance and then sending out whatever you feel like !
In the end I had to go to Sainsbury to buy a run of the mill cake which I should have just done in the first place.

Also after writing this review I’ve received an email saying if I take it down I can have a refund.
It’s the principle of being lied too that annoyed me the most .

Arrived Thursday and her birthday meal was on Saturday..

We had 4 slices for ourselves and sent 3 slices to friends in another part of the restaurant (socially distanced) Great reviews all round.

Service and delivery all as planned although a £5 Saturday delivery charge was added on sneaky at the end, even though the usual 2 day delivery would have made it a Saturday anyway. This made the delivery £13.75 which by anybody’s standards is pretty ridiculous.
Cake was nice, not a Biscoff cake so much as a normal sponge with chocolate & lotus biscuits on top which were a bit soggy and old tasting. The cake was unbearably sweet and leaves you with a wrinkly sugar burned mouth and kind of sick feeling. That was just a normal/small slice of cake. All in all the cake worked out at £48.75 and nobody in my house wants a second slice. Waste of money.

Tony from desserts delivered contacted us offering a full refund in exchange for removing this review. He said he was shocked that we had been unhappy. After looking back at the other 1 and 2 star reviews I realised that this happens any time he gets a bad review and people remove them. Honestly I’m glad I found out as I could not figure out how this company had 4.6/5 reviews, now it makes sense. In light of this I refused the refund and wanted to keep my review posted. He got it taken down by trustpilot accusing me of never being a customer, but after being verified by them it has now been reposted. These are not made to order cakes, they are clearly factory made hence the reason you can not make ANY changes to them.

2 reviews,Courtney Rimmer,GB,Updated 14 Sept 2020,Awful Customer Service DO NOT USE,"My wife ordered a cake for our friends birthday, and the cake never arrived on time. Despite paying £7.99 for nominated day delivery and an extra £5 for the date being a Saturday. Things happen so naturally my wife requested a refund as the cake never showed up on time, as we had to buy another. Communication was poor and they initially refused a refund. Only when a review was placed on Trustpilot did they fully engage; arguing the cake had been delivered and offering a refund only if the review was taken down. The company was blatantly lying, as a delivery man showed up 3 days later with the cake. Absolutely awful customer service, do not use!!!

In response to the company’s reply below, I have photographic evidence with time stamp proving delivery was several days late. Shocking service

Cake box arrived in large cooler box with actual cake in smaller well presented box. Cake itself was slightly smaller than I expected for the price however the cake was well presented. I chose the Bueno cake and taste was perfect so light and fluffy (a previous review mentioned more icing than cake) there is icing around the cake however this is a light chocolate icing that blends well with the lightness of the whole cake.

A day earlier than requested, whilst at work I received a call/voicemail message stating that they’d been to my house to try and deliver the cake. (Very lucky my fiancée wasn’t in).   I explained that it was the following day I had requested delivery of the cake and they said they would bring it back on the correct day between 6-7pm. I explained that was fine but that I had to leave at 20 past 7.    7pm came and went and no sign of the cake.  Called the store and was told the driver was on the way, however by 20 past it had still not arrived and I had to leave.  On returning home later that evening I called the store to let them know they could deliver anytime from then on, and an hour or so later the cake arrived.

I normally bake homemade but wanted something more special with it being his birthday. When they eventually arrived you could tell just by looking at them they were nothing more than normal brownies that had been put in the freezer ... We eat half of one & the rest went in the bin ... Were that dry & stodgy totally not edible. Felt totally let down & £20 just ended in the bin! What a waste! Don’t know how you can get away with selling such horrible products at these prices! Birthday Treat Disaster! ... Emailed several times now & not one response! Full refund should be given! Expecting this review to go straight in the clouds & again no response!

Update ... After been promised a ‘full refund’ in response to my review this was not so ... ‘Tony’ asked me to delete my review & then a refund would be given ... I replied that I’d only take my review down once payment was received in full ‘as promised’ ... Absolutely disgusted with this companies behaviour & attitude. Never come across such appalling customer service! ... Promise a full refund on a review reply publicly only to be given an ultimatum & no intentions of actually paying it any how!!!

As you know you didn’t ask for the brownies back as I’d already put them in the bin un eaten & said so ... They were in edible! You’ve just emailed me saying‘You’re going to process a full refund AND give me 50% off any of your products’!!! ... Minutes later your replying full of lies on this platform! ... I can prove everything by all email correspondence! ... Could of been settled by a full refund as repeatedly promised! ... I’m now taking this further & have documentation of every email you have sent ... Repeatedly telling me to remove my review ... Absolutely despicable! The truth will come out now ...

My daughter loved hers. It came perfectly neatly packaged. I no what some delivery drivers are like when their chucking about parcels so I was a little nervous to how it would arrive but this was different it came perfect all wrapped up to perfection. Looks can be deceiving they make look like small cakes because they've arrived in a huge box but... I think when you cut into it it's quite generous and really really filling perfect size. I'll be ordering my cakes from this company in future. The tracking is brilliant also.

It comes neatly packaged in a huge box, and the driver ensures you receive the item by hand. It’s not like usual delivery that’s left on the floor.
Cakes a bit smaller than I thought but it’s delicious, super rich so you don’t need more than a very small slice, it could very easily feed about 8-10 people over two days ( no honestly, it’s really rich). It has buttercream in the layers so very moist sponge, soft and would not guess it arrives frozen.

11 reviews,Hamilton,GB,Updated 13 Jul 2020,I would have given it zero!!!,"I would have given it zero!!!

Delivery driver lost my parcel when he left it at a strangers address, I then had to knock on a number of doors and eventually found it.

Contacted the courier company and made a complaint and also contacted DESERTS DELIVERED during the process of my parcel going missing and recieved an email, which proceeded to tell me that it had nothing to do with them and they were located in a different city and I must speak with the courier company myself.

At the time, I explained that I did but needed their help as well since this is the courier service they used to deliver their goods but again the same operator who seemed to be the only person manning the emails would not help.

We went back and fourth and the last email response proceeded to imply that regardless of my custom they had a great order value.

As you are aware I managed to locate my parcel myself but with everything going on with covid 19 you can understand that having a parcel with food left at a strangers property, is very frightening.

I urge you to think carefully when ordering from this company and if you do and your parcel goes missing they will not help or take any accountability regarding the matter and it would mean losing all your money.

Also although the cake looked very pleasing to the eye when I eventually ate it, it was dry, however my son liked it but definitely not worth the money and I WOULD NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!

P.S This review was edited as my review was reported but if you have repeat orders like you say then why care about one persons views? Take from that as you will...

Buy at your own risk!

However I can understand it's not the company's fault and that sometimes maybe these things can't be helped when driving etc so I tried to make the best with a chunk of the top missing. It was much smaller than I had imagined, but again that was me clearly no good with sizes. However we were all looking forward to tasting the oreo cake for my sons birthday, but it was a massive disappointment very few people actually ate it, so it was a complete waste. The buttercream didn't seem to go down well. I guess everyone's taste is different, but sadly I don't think I'll be ordering again for what was paid with shipping for me it wasn't worth it.",Date of experience: 11 July 2020,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,11-Jul-20,Please email sales@dessertsdeliveredbakery.co.uk,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

No info on day of delivery as to when it would roughly arrive. I emailed DDB company and after a few hours they gave me a number to contact courier, that company then gave me a number for a local courier by now it was 2pm. My local courier said “yes we have your cake, it arrived at 10 am but our drivers had left by then so we will deliver it tomorrow”. Tbh not good enough, yes I ordered it with a day to spare but the very least the courier should do is let people know if they are/are not delivering on a specific date. I took the decision to go and collect the cake 20 mins by car, it didn’t really suit but thought better than waiting for another day at home the following day for it to arrive.I realise this is not the cake company’s fault and more a courier issue but wouldn’t order again due to this.",Date of experience: 06 July 2020,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

First time was in mid lockdown. They sent the wrong cake but I was still pleased with it and they did well considering the situation.
The second time, no problems at all. Delivery was on time and the person who's birthday it was on both occasions was pleased.
The reason for giving 4 stars is because both times the cake arrived, it was a bit wonky and had slid of it board in transport and the prices have gone up quite a bit since my first order.

4 reviews,Gina Houslin,GB,01-Jul-20,Very disappointed,"Last year October I ordered two cakes from here, for both of my daughters as there birthdays are a day apart I ordered 2 weeks early. Cakes arrived on time they where lovely and taste wonderful , one was Oreo cake the other was unicorn cake. So I this year I recommended that my sister order from them again for our mothers 60th!
Well very disappointed, the cake was a white chocolate Lindt cake. Flavourless!!! It was decorated terrible, sitting on one side of the board, And half the size than what we received before. It’s was a special occasion and was sadly let down. I was horrified to find out my sister paid more for this one cake than I paid for 2 from the same company. Considering what’s been going on with the world being on lockdown I would expect better. I certainly won’t be ordering or recommending them to anyone again.",Date of experience: 01 July 2020,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,20-Jul-20,"Not sure what has happened here, as you can see by our reviews everyone loves them.

1 review,Tamai Houslin,GB,01-Jul-20,Highly unsatisfied,"A cake was ordered for my nans birthday, a white chocolate Lindt cake. Was expecting this cake to be a decent size delicious white chocolate cake as my sister and I had our birthday cakes made by this company, mine was a Oreo cake and my sisters was a unicorn cake. They were a decent size cake for the price and everyone loved but this time they didn’t deliver. The price was ridiculous for the size of the cake, wasn’t even placed properly on the cake board, decoration wasn’t great, it looked like it had dropped a bit, the taste wasn’t great either, it tasted like cheap ingredients was used. As it was a special day we was really disappointed with what they had delivered and was ashamed to even present this to everyone. Not happy at all, won’t be ordering anymore cakes from here again.",Date of experience: 01 July 2020,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,02-Jul-20,Pls email us on sales@dessertsdeliveredbakery.co.uk we can not find your order,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

12 reviews,Mrs Carole Hafeez,GB,Updated 1 Jul 2020,Bad reviews get removed ??,"I left a mediocre review for my purchase a few weeks ago and it was removed for a breach of something.... (They have now had to reinstate it but with a reply arguing with our opinion) The day I looked, many others had been 'removed' too and only the good reviews were showing - hmmmmm be warned!
The cake we bought for my son's 18th didn't even get finished off in a household with 4 children as it was so tasteless! I have never ever known this in my house .
I notice a bad review was posted 3 hours ago, how long before that disappears too?
And now this too is under review for breach of terms... ??How are they getting away with it? There are regular bad reviews about cakes being dry and tasteless and they remove them all?!!!!",Date of experience: 01 July 2020,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,01-Jul-20,Trust pilot removes fake reviews that are untrue.

I am very disappointed at what we received as it was bought for my Mums 60th. We were looking forward to this, considering the current climate. I will not be buying a cake from this site again!

UPDATE:
This company has VERY poor customer service and would not give me my refund, which is deserved, until I took down my review which is 100% truthful! The customer service representative was very unprofessional and rude! Please do not use this dessert service as they do not deserve our money!

such a shame you deliver via APC as driver tipped it over to carry - driver didnt care and said it had been kicked around this morning before he got it - as it cost £7.99 for delivery this kinda sucks but not your companys fault.

We required it to be frozen as we were going to defrost for a party the following weekend and this was the only day we could accept a delivery as my wife and i are both key workers and working 6 days a week.We didnt receive any tracking (which is forgiveable given the current climate) but the cake was delivered at room temperature. I contacted the office to enquire why it was not delivered frozen and was told ""all our cakes are sent out frozen"". Completely dismissive of the fact that our cake was not sent frozen it was chilled meaning we had no idea whether we could freeze it for the event or not. I also asked about allergen information for the product as the allergen leaflet included with our order didnt list that particular cake. Again this request was ignored.
Shoddy customer service and a mediocre product.

All of the cakes are good for 7 days as explained online as well as the delivery process. The fact that you did not read this properly is not our fault.

i have been asked by desserts delivered to remove my post and they will give me a full refund. having had several emails it is quite clear this company is not good to deal with should something go wrong. they have lied in their reply put up 6 days after mine and you will see this from their emails,its a shame really because i used them a year ago and not a problem and this was not their fault as it went wrong with their courier but their aftercare is diabolical.so they dispatched my cake and i received an email from courier with tracking details. it was and never has been delivered and when i try and track it the message is no information available
Hi so sorry about this, we use a courier to deliver and as far as we know they are having staffing issues. I will email them now and see what is going on but it may be best for you to also try and contact them on ******, apologies for the inconvenience we are all trying our best in this difficult time.

hi, my order should have arrived yesterday but has not. it is my daughters birthday tomorrow so please can you guarantee it will come today please. when i try and track it it just says no information available.

Hi mr.l i have emailed them for an investigation i will refund the delivery charge for you. Please can you remove the review as it can be very damaging for us

Hi
Not received cake so please can you issue a full refund forthwith and if you could send me a link to the review I will remove following my full refund.

Kind regards
Hi mr, apologies regarding this, it will be delivered tomorrow due to the couriers being delayed. I will refund you in full as this is not your fault and pls keep the cake, Let me know once review is removed i will pass on to refunds department

Thanks
Dear sir,
Just to inform you the cake has never arrived but neither has the full credit you now owe me for the failure to deliver. Please can you credit the full amount including delivery charges etc asap. If I have not had a refund by Monday 15/06/2020 i will contact my bank for a recharge,

Kind regards
Hi mr can you please remove the trust pilot review and we agreed on a full refund?
Dear sir,
My review has nothing to do with the fact you have failed to supply the goods ordered. I am legally entitled for a full refund so please do this and not hold me to ransom that you will only do it if I remove the review.

Hi mr we used *** courier to send the parcel here is the proof below. You would need to contact them as we paid them to deliver and it was dispatched.
As a good will if you removed the review my boss said he would refund in full to close the matter but obviously you do not want to do this so we will continue to contact the courier to see where this has got to.

Thanks
Dear sir,

Maybe you and your boss do not understand my contract is with you not your courier. I do not need to contact them that is not for me to do. You entered into a contract taking my money for the supply of goods to be delivered on 3rd or 4th of june for my daughters birthday on the 6th. You failed to fulfill that contract and so I am entitled to a full refund. I will not be blackmailed into removing the review 1st. I will get my money back anyway but I am giving you the chance to do the right thing the choice is yours.

Regards
Hi mr, i think your a little confused, we are not black mailing anyone but in your review you have said no one has contacted you on email which we have? Your lying in your review and we would like to sort that out? I will chase the courier now for you

dear sir,
I have a timeline you did not reply until after the review. I got automated replies 3 times then I posted the review stating that and then you replied. Please do not call me a liar.

I am not calling you a lier but the review is not true when i am replying now?


dear sir,
Why have you lied on trustpilot? You have said my cake had arrived. That is very naughty of you. I have used your company in the past without a problem. I do not blame you for the courier not delivering my cake these things happen but your treatment after that has been dismal. You say on trustpilot it had arrived but emails to me before you posted confirm that you know it had not been delivered. I post 6 days ago and you accuse me of putting wrong date for delivery. The invoice clearly says delivery for 04/06/2020. Now the 11/06/2020 and if it was delivered why the previous emails from you, not once have you mentioned it was delivered. Your courier let you down it happens not the end of the world get over it do the right thing grow a pair and credit money back into my account, i will post on trustpilot

After reply from company:
It wasn't a logo. It was a description of the cake I brought. I wanted to surprise my partner with a special cake. The box actually said on it ""Chocolate rainbow cake"" which obviously gives away the surprise.

However, it was small for the price (this wasn’t a surprise as the site is clear on size, but is worth noting). Also, the amount of packaging is quite something.

SUCH DESPERATE MEASURES TO HIDE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ONLY ADD TO THE DISHONESTY OF THIS COMPANY.
I CANNOT REITERATE AGAIN **AVOID AT ALL COSTS**
THIS COMPANY ALSO ORIGINALLY SAID ON ITS INSTAGRAM IT WAS RASING ITS PRICES FOR 2 WEEKS ONLY CITING THE OUTBREAK AND SUPPLIER ISSUES. YET 2 MONTHS ON THIER PRICES REMAIN HIKED. AVOID.

***ADDITIONAL UPDATE*** Company just
emailed offering refund for removal of my review. I refused and pointed to the lie made in regards to me asking for a refund. Received a vile response, shouldn’t be surprised if this is how they operate. Emails forwarded to Trust Pilot Integrity department. Trading standards notified and responded. Competition & Markets Authority who look into price gouging report form also been sent as advised. I don’t respond kindly to intimidating emails from the owner of this company hence my further updated review. Definitely BUYER BEWARE!!!!

**UPDATED REVIEW** As suspected company trying to get my review removed claiming to be fake. Order number and receipt given as proof. Also claiming I asked for a refund for the dry brownies. No refund was ever requested or contact made with the company regarding the wrong drink or the dry brownies. You requested proof of my order number so now you provide me with the email I allegedly asked you for a refund. As you want to bring up trading standards I will be contacting them in the morning regarding your price hikes and profiteering during this crisis.

Despicable and dishonest company with absolutely zero customer service or decorum.

Brownies very very dry, wrong drink delivered. Ridiculous price hikes in the last few days well beyond supposed supply increases. £10 extra per cake in some instances.
Company doesn’t take negative views well and removes comments from social media sites hence having to resort to trust pilot.

The cake arrived on Thursday as planed and they had put in an extra item anyway! The cake look lovely, If I had asked a local cake maker to make it, it would of been nearly double the price.

THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A FAKE REVIEW! - COMPANY DID NOT TRY TO CONTACT ME!!!

16 reviews,Sarah,GB,13-Dec-19,Peanut butter cake,"My daughter really loved this cake for her 12th birthday as she is a huge reeces fan.

The cake was really well packaged. Seriously you could leave the cake anywhere and nothing could happen to it, it was that well packaged. I ordered it the day before so it had plenty of time to defrost and also I wouldn't have ro pay the extra weekend delivery charge. I Had the option to have it delivered in a safe place as I'd be at work.

The cake looked small, especially after taking it out of the huge polystyrene box, which has compartments which hold their own box tight so and then even in their box it is then wrapped up but honestly looks can be deceiving. The cake is deep and we had plenty left over.

The cake was so moist and delicious, even my mom who doesn't like sponge loved this cake. Even the left over after a few days stayed moist and delicious. It was honestly the best cake I've ever tasted.

I will definately be ordering again. Hopefully the next cake I order from them will be for Christmas as they've got a couple of really lovely looking Christmas cakes on their website now.",Date of experience: 13 December 2019,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

1 review,Ash,GB,03-Aug-19,Poor service,"Order came when it said delivery was good. The disappointing things:
1) the items I ordered, two of which were completely wrong.
2) the brownies tasted absolutely burnt.
3) when contacting the customer service, the response about the wrong items was ‘thanks I’ll pass on to a manager’ no solution offered.
4) the actual cake I received even though wrong also tasted awful and the icing had separated.

Won’t be ordering again.",Date of experience: 03 August 2019,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,04-Aug-19,"1. We ran out of white kit kat and could not get through to you on the phone so replaced with white lion bar.
2. We make our brownies fresh every single day it is highly unlikely our brownies are ""burnt""
3. A manager contacted you and offered the entire order again for free.
4. Please take a look at our reviews. Our cakes are high quality and look spectacular.

7 reviews,Marie Caruana,GB,Updated 24 May 2019,Definitely worth ordering from........,"Our favourite online bakery (choccywoccydoodah) had gone into administration and I needed a high quality alternative for my daughter’s upcoming 16th birthday. I googled and googled and came across desserts delivered bakery. They seemed very good at what they do so I checked out their FB page and testimonials and decided to place an order. There was a great choice of cakes to order and they all looked delicious. I plumbed for the deluxe Ferrero Rocher cake and was not disappointed! The cake was extremely well packaged and was immaculate upon opening the box. Although it looks quite small, you can easily get at least 10 good slices out of it and because I’d chosen a rich cake you couldn’t eat too big a piece anyway. My daughter loved it, it looked very posh and was exactly what I wanted for her special day. I wouldn’t hesitate in ordering another cake again. My only small criticism is that the cake board could be a bit stronger but other than that it was a 10/10 experience.",Date of experience: 24 May 2019,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

I will definitely be ordering from you again. The cake was definitely a home baked cake, rather than a mass produced cake.

Great service, fast delivery and amazing quality with a high end taste. The best part was, the cake was delivered in the best packaging and it resulted in no damage and tasted delicious.

Thank you very much.

1 review,Laura Blake,GB,Updated 2 May 2019,let down because of “too many complaints”!,"Ordered a month in advance. 2 days before birthday they email to say they no longer make the cake I ordered because of too many complaints ! So let down with no cake and put off ordering again because of sloppy service and apparently bad products if they have so many complaints ! TERRIBLE

Ps they have since emailed me to say I’m lying. Please see below for their actual correspondence with me for evidence none of the above is a lie:

So sorry we have stopped this cake due to many customer complaints but we can change for any other online?

You need to pay £18 extra ontop of thestandard £7.99 for next day Saturday delivery which is not a problem. However, my order did not arrive. I did not receive any dispatch emails. When trying to get in contact with the company there are no contact numbers so I had to send an email which was not replied to until the day after my delivery was supposed to arrive which was not helpful as the occasion had past and I had to go out and buy another cake!! Another unsatisfied customer. I would avoid.

Updated 04/03/19 - my delivery address was not entered incorrectly as stated in the response from the company. I have an email from them where they stated they were having issues with their courier when I asked them where my order was.

I was sent a rainbow cake instead of the Nutella cake. After quite a few rude dismissive emails back from the company I was offered a refund if I paid for the cake to be returned. Which I would of happily done if the fault was my own and not the mistake made by the company. My emails then just got ignored and no refund given. The cake didn’t even get eaten as I was waiting for a response to the last email about next steps and I had to go buy a suitable cake for my husband on top of what I had already spent. Considering cakes are generally for a special occasion I couldn’t rate there customer service and company more poorly specially when the error was made from there side. Don’t make the mistake I did just go buy a cake from a trusted retailer.

Update to their response - a courier company does not pack the incorrect cake and also miss the candles from the order. I also need not deal with them when trying to find a solution.

3 reviews,Steve Cahill.,GB,Updated 5 Mar 2019,Hello,"Hello, our young Sons Birthday cake was supposed to be delivered on Friday. We placed the order 3 weeks ago with you.

Your courier text on Friday to say they would not be able to deliver and would do so in two working days..

My wife emailed you on Friday to explain that this would mean we’d have no cake for his Birthday and to cancel the delivery.

You told us to contact your courier directly which we explained we could not do.

Your courier did deliver a day late even though we asked you to cancel as the cake was late.

We’ve now been told to return the cake to you at our cost otherwise you won’t issue a refund?!..

I believe that the cost of sending this cake back to you may be more expensive than the £25 fee we initially paid.

We’ve had many emails from Tony and not once has any apology been offered..

I understand that the courier is not under your control and sometimes things just don’t go according to plan even with the best of intentions.

To be told that we have to chase your courier directly & that we cannot have a refund unless we courier the cake back to you at our expense seems ridiculous.

The cake is still sat outside in its box as we had to purchase one elsewhere.

Could I suggest you kindly allow us to put the cake in the bin and issue us with a full refund?

I’m not too sure why you’d even want a stale cake back?

I believe the request to ship the cake back to you is merely designed to put customers off doing so due to the cost involved.

Our customer service experience so far is sadly not what we would have expected.

This was our second order placed with you and we had hoped to place a third on Monday for my Mums Birthday...

It took several methods of contact to get an answer from them. Isaid I don’t want the order anymore as it was a day late but they still sent it. I have paid for a gold topper that I never received and they are refusing to send my money back until I send the cake back. I said I’m not sending the cake back I just want what’s mine. It is appalling I have to beg for my own money back. They have deleted my comments from Instagram and blocked me. There was another person in the same situation and they deleted her comments too.

2 reviews,Miss Heyes,GB,22-Mar-18,Avoid avoid avoid. Plain rude.,"The customer service or should I say 'Tony D's attitude is shocking.
I ordered a birthday cake for my step father which arrived okay - it had white plastic bits in the icing which obviously disappointing not to mention dangerous.
Before I had even noted these issues i had complained via Instagram which was ignored and via email which was replied by the ever so delightful Tony D.
I complained as there was an offer on Instagram for a slice of mini egg came free with ANY weekend orders and the link to dessertsdelivered.co.uk here I placed my order for the cake and input the code into the note section as advised on Instagram .
The extra slice never turned up I complained was told I was wrong as the companies are seperate (funny how I managed to order from the website on the Instagram post ??)
Advised that maybe this should be clarified on future Instagram posts as misleading.
Tony however knows my mind clearly and told me in fact no it's not misleading. Obviously Tony that's why I wasted time writing to your lovely self.
Suggestions for everyone don't use unless you want crap customer service, and your relative to choke on plastic from a disappointingly small and expensive cake.
Surprised they don't make fruitcakes here I reckon they'd be good at them ??",Date of experience: 22 March 2018,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,04-Mar-19,THIS REVIEW WAS MADE WHEN WE USED AN OLD COURIER WHO FAILED MANY DELIVERIES WE HAVE NOW CHANGED TO A NEW COURIER WITH A 99.9% SUCESS RATE,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4
7 reviews,Zander White,GB,Updated 4 Mar 2019,"Wrong Cake, Non-Existent Customer Service","Overall, I would recommend that you do not use this company. You may be lucky and have no issues with your cake (which is great) but if you have any issues like I did then do not expect to receive any decent customer service, as you won't get any. See below for my full review...

Having seen Desserts Delivered Bakery on Facebook I decided to order a cake for my partner for her birthday.
I ordered the cake a week in advance but obviously due to the nature of a cake being perishable it was only shipped the day before for next day delivery. Unfortunately the cake did not arrive on the date that I requested but instead arrived the day afterwards. The cakes are sent frozen with dry ice and inside a polystyrene box.
As it did not arrive next-day the cake had defrosted by the time it arrived it was stuck to the packaging inside, compromising the aesthetics of the cake (not the end of the world of course)

However my main fault / complaint is not with the aesthetics of the cake but the inside of the cake and the customer service I then received following my complaint.
The inside of the cake was advertised as being both plain & chocolate sponge but when I cut into it the cake was fully chocolate cake. Due to this I contacted the company who apologised and offered to send me a replacement free of charge (which was brilliant), I responded and said this would be great but only if they could clarify that I would definitely receive the correct cake. I did not get a response to my email but instead they sent the cake out straight away without clarifying
The replacement arrived the next day (which again was great) however it was still the incorrect sponge. I complained again and they apologised and I was informed that the bakers were mixing up two of their cakes.

After this I then asked what was to come of the second cake as it was incorrect and I still had not recieved the cake that I had paid for and ordered. The response was that I could return the cake as long as it was in the same condition that it arrived in. Obviously this was not possible as the issue was with the sponge and not external and I had to cut into it to see this issue. I was then informed that I could not return the cake due to this.

After much back and forth I have now given up with my complaint, the gentleman that I was speaking with (Tony) clearly did not care about the issue I was having and kept referring me to their ""legal terms and conditions"" rather than actually responding to the questions I was asking / the complaint that I was making.

EDIT: The company’s response does not explain their atrocious customer service.",Date of experience: 19 March 2018,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,04-Mar-19,THIS REVIEW WAS MADE WHEN WE USED AN OLD COURIER WHO FAILED MANY DELIVERIES WE HAVE NOW CHANGED TO A NEW COURIER WITH A 99.9% SUCESS RATE,Desserts Delivered Bakery,4

2 reviews,Kate Sands,GB,03-Jun-23,"Sweet, rich and indulgent","The Cookie People cookies are delicious, I have had them in the past, and sent as gifts,which have always been well received! This time I ordered a mixed box with flavours I chose myself, and surprisingly my favourite was the strawberry one with pop tarts on it, it wasn't as overwhelmingly sweet as I thought it was going to be! I really enjoyed it.
My least favourite, which came as a surprise, was the cinnabon one... it was so sweet, that even with my sweet tooth I couldn't manage it. I loved the cinnamonness of it but I couldn't handle the sweetness. I had to leave it. My 2nd or could it be joint favourite with the strawberry? Was the toffee crisp cookie, sweet but I love toffee crisp, I enjoyed that one very much. The Biscoffi one was scoffed very quickly too . Definitely flavours to have again,except sadly for the cinnamon cookie, that's a no im afraid, sadly.
Well packaged and protected with the packing noodles. Survived the trip via Royal Mail.
A lovely indulgent sweet sticky treat.",Date of experience: 26 May 2023,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,,The Cookie People,4.9

I don’t know if I’m used to everything being so easily accessible but waiting 5 days for these to arrive felt a long time!
I think the packaging is perfect but I do also feel the postage is a little pricey for the amount of time I waited for these to arrive.

If you can plan ahead and can afford to wait for their arrival these are a fab bougie gift and or treat!!",Date of experience: 15 August 2022,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,,"hi Jake!

thanks so much for leaving us a review,
we are so glad you like your products and was happy with the packaging

I do feel the 3 star review is a little sad to read :-( especially when you seem to be happy with the products.

we do state on our website when ordering when to expect the delivery giving our customers all the information so they can decide if they are happy to place an order knowing how long delivery will take.

as we are a bakery who bake everything in-house and also we have such high standards with our product quality, making sure our products get to you as fresh as possible means we take your order then we process and arrange the baking schedule so that we can bake and post the order the same day.

we also post every order tracked 24 so that you receive it the day after it was baked meaning that everything is as fresh as we could possibly get it to you.

its so hard as we are often expected to keep up with the huge companies that are sending non food items and we simply couldn't do this whilst making sure our that quality comes first which in our opinion it always should.

I do know some company bake ahead of time so that they can send the items on the same day they was ordered but this means the products are already a day or 2 old before they even get sent to you.

unfortunately cookie have 3-5 days shelf life, so we would rather give the customer all the information on the length of time to expect the order this is no more then 5 working days and not sacrifice the quality you receive.

also the postage cost is actually what we pay to Royal Mail so we don't have very much choice on what we can do here, unless we send on a second class basis but again this affects the quality.

we really have tried to make sure you receive your order in the best condition and to give you a all the information so you would know what to expect.

but thanks so much for choosing to order from us as small business it means a lot and we really value your custom.

also reviews are massive part of us gaining more customers

It’s Trustpilot who automatically send out ‘review emails’ unfortunately, they don’t come directly from us.

We’re sorry your order hasn’t arrived yet but as a small independent business we’re gutted that you’ve give us a 1* even though the delivery timescale is completely out of our hands once Royal Mail have it.

We hope you can edit this review once your order arrives which looks like it will be today

Thanks",The Cookie People,4.9

Both when I made a mistake on the delivery address (which when I called was so quickly rectified without any bother at all!) but also when I called to see if my Christmas pre-order was likely to arrive by a specific day as the recipient was going away (they sent by Royal Mail 24 hour tracked at no extra cost to myself as they knew the postal strikes would cause delayed and they wanted to try and ensure they were prioritised as best as they could!).

Full disclosure, I met her and her husband a few years ago before I knew about the business, and I have ordered lots of her produce over the years and had excellent feedback from my clients that I sent it out to.

I’ve sent her biscuits out over the years with a thank you message on them, packaged them up with a covering letter to my clients and it’s another way of telling my clients I value them…

Anyway, excellent service, great product and an easy process.

If this related to your Christmas pre-order then we can only apologise if the information on our website was not clear & you didn't realise that we wouldn't be shipping Christmas biscuits in November...we always want them to arrive just before a special occasion so that they are as fresh as possible. We upgraded the shipping (at our cost) to a tracked service for many of our Christmas orders & we can see that your order arrived on 16th Dec, in plenty of time before the big day!

If this was another order that has arrived much later than expected, we had no contact from you to let us know of the issue and we would have quickly resolved this for you!

The postal strikes have been on going for many months now & they are sadly causing delays to orders. Delays which are totally out of our control.

Either way, we would always ask that you contact us first before leaving a review, it doesn't seem fair to blame us for something which isn't our fault.

Sending nothing but best wishes & our apologies, The Kitsch Hen Biscuit Team.",The Kitsch Hen,4.9

8 reviews,Joanna Ferraro,GB,24-Jan-22,"Appalling customer service from Caroline, the owner","Sadly, I've had a very poor experience with Caroline, the owner of Kitsch Hen.  Her customer service skills are horrifyingly appalling! She fails to respond to emails and text messages, doesn't answer the phone, and when she does, she lies and makes promises to get back to you when she actually doesn't.  On two occasions now, I have tried to order biscuit cakes from her.  On the first occasion, April last year, she said she couldn't make one for me - and there she took her time responding, leaving me with very little time to sort an alternative.  More recently, the second time, she did the same again, but on this occasion, she sadly lied and was dishonest enough to tell me that she had been busy in a meeting all day.  At which point, as a test, I got my mother to call instead.  Of course, she answered the calls.  I texted her to find out why she was avoiding my calls/messages and why she was lying.     There is history between Caroline and myself.  Back in 2020, she had made me a number of Wedding Invitation biscuits for my wedding.  When I collected the order, at which point I must add, she also failed to deliver on time, I found all of the packaged wedding biscuits to be imperfect.  The gold paint had not been dried enough for them to be damaged/marked by the greaseproof paper, which of course the paint was smeared all over too.  Of course, I expressed my dissatisfaction graciously.  I expected nothing less than what she had promised, a perfect quality product.  These after all, were going out as invites to all of my wedding guests!  Caroline at this point had broken down in distress with tears, going on to explain that it was all due to her ongoing domestic personal issues.So, I did the decent thing, and offered to help her in several ways.  By allowing her to take her time and remake the biscuits, and delaying the delivery date a further one more time.  By offering to help her remake the biscuits, and/or package the biscuits, or simply do anything else for her she felt would help, whilst at the same time continuing to console her by hugging her, wiping away her tears and listening to her problems!  I was patient, understanding, empathetic, sympathetic and helpful.  I am simply dismayed and flabbergasted at such horrendous attitude in return.  Caroline needs to remember how to treat people decently back, as life generally works in mysterious ways!!!  She has certainly forgotten how to reciprocate the kindness and generosity of others.  She has become dishonest, ungrateful and arrogant and does not care about decent and good clients like myself.  People - remember to vote with your feet with such uncaring businesses.  They will be here today and gone tomorrow.  Already, we are starting to see the arrogance in her product/work, boring and very samey.  There are better biscuit makers out there , offering the latest and edgy on-trend biscuits.",Date of experience: 24 January 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,03-Feb-22,"Sadly, there are times when a review is more of a personal vendetta which no amount of discussion will change. We know that the words being used to describe Caroline could not be further from the truth & we are fortunate that anyone reading this would realise that.

You have not written this review to warn others, you have written it from a place of negativity. And in all honesty, the fact that you could refer to Caroline’s “ongoing domestic personal issues” as well as write the phase “Caroline needs to remember how to treat people decently back, as life generally works in mysterious ways” in relation to her devastating fertility journey - is the most abhorrent thing we have ever encountered. Your text messages also included that Caroline should remember “karma” and her “difficulties in life” which only cements this further. This along with your review says so much more about you than it ever will about The Kitsch Hen.

The final “insult” of The Kitsch Hen’s products being “boring and very samey” begs the question…if you truly felt that way, why were you so keen to order a biscuit cake?

We truly hope that you find peace in your life as well as a suitable birthday cake for your husband by the end of February.

I bought the ‘choose your own’ box of 6 with one large circle, two smaller circles and three hearts. I wish I’d known the size beforehand though and maybe not ordered. The box they came in was little bigger than A6, so the biscuits all had to fit in there and for £23 I think I’d have shopped elsewhere.

I like the fact that the fruit pies are not over sweet. With a spoonful of clotted cream - delicious.
My only reservation is the packaging my order comes with. The insulated bag and cool pack - could they be returned and reused?
Could an alternative be used for the heavy duty tape used to completely cover the box.
It all keeps the pies in good condition but not great for the environment - all that packaging.

It was worth ordering a little more to qualify for free p&p. I can even re-use the packaging again.
Jennifer even messaged to explain if it was ok to add two extra of another flavour as they thought one of the pies didn’t present properly. It looks perfect to me. How’s that for fabulous quality control!

I didn't notice until I was getting the pie out the fridge for dinner that it was gluten-free; I was a bit cautious as gluten-free pastry can be a bit, well, meh. But no need to worry, the pastry was fantastic, crisp and delicious, making it one of the nicest pies I've eaten and if I'd not seen the box I wouldn't have believed it was gluten-free. It was good value too, I served it with mash and greens and it did two potions.

We noticed that there was a glitch in the postage charge so in good faith- as we would always do- we included some complimentary items to compensate for this. Also included was a note explaining this (hand written by myself - Jane - as we believe in a personal service). We note that none of this has been mentioned in your review.  As for your opinion on the pies,  you can clearly see from our previous 5* reviews, that this has never been the case.

2 reviews,Sharon Wales,GB,11-Jun-20,These pies are absolutely amazing,"These pies are absolutely amazing. My husband ordered a mixed selection, mainly for himself, but included a few vegetarian options for me. I was dubious as I'm not generally a fan of pastry, but as soon as i tasted the pastry on these I was sold - it's light, tasty and not a hint of the heaviness or sogginess that usually puts me off. They are all really generously filled too, so you never feel short changed in content.
My particular favourite is the sweet potato, spinach and goat's cheese, but both varieties of mushroom pie were also really tasty. My husband couldnt choose as he said he loves them all equally. The lamb and mint did get a special mention, though.
We havent tried the sweet pies, but a friend has rated them highly too. They are next on our list. The pies are freezer-ready and delivered in a fab little cold box, which meant that even though I was worried that we'd end up having to cook them all on arrival, they were still frozen perfectly.

Nothing at all to complain about, and well worth the money. Give them a try!",Date of experience: 11 June 2020,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,23-Jun-20,Thank you so much for your detailed review! We really appreciate it :),mumanddadskitchen.co.uk,4.9

When my husband saw they were gluten free he started moaning and asking why I had wasted money. We had a beef pie each for lunch today (the rest are in the freezer), they were excellent! He had to admit they didn't taste like they were gluten free lol. Nice proper meat filling, no yucky bits or filler inside, and the pastry was light and perfect too. I served them with home grown veg and gravy made with home grown onions. Definitely looking forward to having another one next week, and will be trying the pulled pork one then too.

Have ordered previously and thought they were lovely quality and great taste.

However I ordered a Christmas brownie and cookie box and it just didn’t taste as fresh as it previously had and the flavours weren’t as good. Not bad enough that you’d complain or not eat but half did go in the bin as I just wasn’t that tempted to go back for more.

If I saw a really unique flavour or concept I might be tempted to try? But for your ‘standard’ flavours i just didn’t feel the price and quality were aligned. Also not overly keen on some of the content which has felt a bit guilt trippy it manipulative, I’m sure not the intention but I don’t want to feel personally responsible for a business owners happiness and well-being.",Date of experience: 22 December 2023,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,22-Feb-24,"Hi Lucy

I’m glad to hear you have enjoyed your previous orders, but I’m genuinely sorry to read you were disappointed with your recent purchase. We bake everything fresh and price all our products fairly for the quality of ingredients we use. On this occasion, this box may not have been for you, but we take all feedback on board.

I am also sorry you have not been enjoying our content. As you said, it is not our intention to ever manipulate our customers.

The fabulous team at dunk have a gift in creating or (re creating) these array of flavours and making it their own.
You know how there is different milk chocolate. That's Dunk Dips.
The banana and custard is a flavour all on its own, and the custard compliments the banana so well that it doesn't have that banana aftertaste, think custard cream meets chocolate with a dash of banana for the secret ingredient. I hear it's being discontinued but I for one put a vote in for banoffee as I can already imagine it tasting as moreish as old school sweets toffo

I love the products, I’ve tried a range of cookies, dips, brownies, blondies, sample boxes, limited edition products. I feel like I’ve sampled a lot. There is definitely something for everyone, I haven’t loved everything but then I wouldn’t expected too. The quality has always been there, the freshness too - even when DPD have been a day late delivering it has still been super fresh. I like the option to freeze things (not all of it freezes but lots does) - especially when you’re buying a lucky dip box as it’s a lot of product to consume in a short time frame.
I personally love the packaging and knowing it’s environmentally as friendly as can be. That really stuck out for me. I like that is is a small business and really believe such businesses should be heavily supported, it is not an easy thing to do; given the currently climate.

They sell the very best cookies I’ve ever ordered - super fresh, always delicious with creative cookie combinations -, and the quality of the dips is out of this world (Dunkstar Martini addict here).

The current delivery system is great - you’re guaranteed a delivery date based on the day of the week you order. The cookies are always so fresh, that it’s never a problem if you’re out and can’t receive your order on the day, or end up getting your parcel from a DPD pick up shop a couple of days later.

1 review,Al,GB,Updated 29 Apr 2022,Spring Fair Themed Box,"First of all can I just say that I've bought a lot of cookies and dips from Dunk Cookies and their products are amazing, but on this occasion I feel extremely disappointed.

Usually their themed boxes are great products and great value for money but their Spring Fair Box, in my opinion, was poor and I feel like I've been taken for a ride!

Considering subscribers got this box for the sale price of £27 not £32 it's the worst box I've ever received.

The new bundle on sale at £25 is better value as it has more products.

Sorry to leave this review but seriously I think you should contact everyone who bought the Spring Fair Box as it certainly wasn't what you said in the description ""the best of dunk"". It's put me off buying themed boxes again but as I said your cookies and dips are lovely it's just a shame about this themed box. Four products for £27 (or usual price £32)! A bag of vanilla cookies with a small plastic tub of dip, cookie fries with a small plastic tub of dip, 2 flat ring doughnuts with white chocolate icing and one small hot dog cake (possibly the size of 2 small angel slice cakes from Mr Kipling).

Even if the dips were the regular size this might have been a bit better. I've put half of my cookies in the freezer for when I buy more dip as the dips were far too small.",Date of experience: 18 April 2022,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,18-Apr-22,"Hello, thank you for your feedback, and we are sorry you didn’t love your themed box this time around.

We always strive to make every experience with Dunk magical. We’ve been trying to do this for years, and even though we’ve created hundreds of goodies, we still want every single one to be special for our customers.

Our aim, particularly with themed boxes, is to create items we haven’t seen anywhere in the market before, such as the hot dog cakes and cookie doughnuts in the Spring Fair Box. Creating new items require specialist moulds and considerable product development. Alongside the bakes, these boxes focus on the experience of how they can be enjoyed (cookie fries’ packet & cookie/dip cone etc).

With any new product there are always risks when trying to create something new, and pushing the boundaries of what you do. We appreciate we won’t always hit the mark with everybody, but we do always want to push ourselves to try and create new and special things for our customers. So absolutely, we take your comments on board for future boxes.

However, our recent delivery before Xmas arrived and was stale, the cookies were way too crumbly to dip them into any of the dips and they didn’t taste as the usually do… not sure if it’s cheaper ingredients, different bakers or what but was quite disappointed over Xmas!! My sister also had a delivery and said she had to throw away a brownie among other things because it was so dry, delivery for her was £12 too!!! Very expensive products for what you get, sadly.

Hi,
I've used your delivery service once before and it all went well.
However, this time it went drastically wrong; I'm in France and had to rely on delivery in the UK from companies over there this Christmas, I ordered the cookies for an address in Essex, they should have arrived in the week before Christmas but in fact, and with no explanation, they were returned to you.
I emailed as soon as I saw this and whilst I realise that you must have been flat out, I'm still waiting for a reply. Sorry, would love to use again but no confidence in your delivery company,",Date of experience: 06 January 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,,"Hi Fiona!

Sorry to hear this! After speaking with Lizzie in our operations team, I believe this was down to an incorrect delivery postcode at ordering & the issue has now been resolved.

2 reviews,Jayne,GB,Updated 17 Dec 2021,Order the cookies and hope no delivery issues,"I've made 5 orders, and the food items are fantastic apart from the chocolate bars are too thick to bite it's painful in my opinion- cookies and dips are great. Really the best.
However if you have issues don't expect a reply within a week or sometimes - at all. Which I didn't have after an order earlier in the year. I've had issues with deliveries and we had to travel 24 mile round trip to collect from the depot a few days later so the items weren't as fresh. I sent a DM on Instagram they replied three days later asking me to email. I emailed, I've had no reply for 9 days and now I'm writing this. No refund of postage offered for the delivery issues we've had and postage is not cheap!! The owner is on Instagram stories all day yet doesn't have time to reply to customers. They use DPD local who are absolutely useless round here, they went to a car wash and wardrobe shop instead of a home address.

Edit - I have had an email and social media response since leaving this review and a comment on insta which I appreciate. No refund of postage offered or alternative shipping options explored at this time. Really sad we won't have those incredible cookies in our future. Just can't be doing with the 24 mile round trip to the depot and the hours on the phone to dpd. Gutted.",Date of experience: 16 December 2021,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,17-Dec-21,"Hi Jayne!

Thanks for your feedback.

Firstly, we'd like to apologise for the delay in responding to you, we've been 3 members down this past week or so due to COVID so it's really been all hands on deck in the kitchen!

We're so glad to hear you love our cookies & dips! We work so hard making all our goodies so it's a shame to hear you've had issues with DPD. We've made notes of all your feedback regarding their service and will definitely pass it on so they can improve in the future!

Thanks for all your support this year! Wishing you a Merry Christmas & Happy New Year

We’re sorry to hear you weren’t 100% happy, and definitely want all of our products to be enjoyed.

We do state on all items, that decorations may vary, as we are not able to be exact as we hand bake and decorate everything.

The Cakesickles wouldn’t have been undercooked - as this is thoroughly checked, but they are mixed with buttercream to make them easier to eat, which may have given the texture you experienced.

If you had contacted us directly we would have definitely put it right however!

A whole chocolate orange cheesecake was my choice and as I live locally to the shop, I opted for collection. I picked the time and date, paid and received a confirmation email.
My order was ready at the allotted time and was a delight, both visually and taste-wise.
The shop stays open late into the evening so it fits in well with most work patterns.
Their cakes are so much nicer than standard shop-bought ones, well worth that bit extra for the sheer pleasure when eating them.",Date of experience: 22 June 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,09-Mar-23,Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your order!,Sians Sweet Treats,4.9

Please accept our apology, and pass our apology on to Steve for us.

I will be offering a full refund as an apology to you, I know this doesn’t make up for them being late, we’re not sure if it was a system issue/ human error and would like to investigate this further - please email contact@sianssweettreats.co.uk or contact us through social media.

I would so love to be able to offer a lower delivery price but we quote the price that the courier charges to us.

2 reviews,Kat H,GB,16-Feb-24,Amazing cake,"The Cake: Very tasty and incredibly beautiful. Really well put together and was exactly what I had hoped for after too much time researching occasion cakes in London.

Delivery: I had this delivered inside London and the process was smooth. The day before I was sent a tracking code for my one hour time slot. Through this on the day I could see when the courier had collected the cake, the estimated time to drop off, and a little icon on the map of where exactly the courier was. Therefore no anxious waiting for the doorbell.

The chocolate sponge is phenomenal. Moist, rich and slightly salted. I also thoroughly enjoyed their lemon ""tiramisu"" cake which was wonderfully light and summery. If you're on the hunt for a super fudgy brownie, they have you covered on that front too! Lastly, I am not really a matcha kinda-gal but I sampled their matcha cookie and must admit, I was impressed.

Only once have I been a little disappointed because I misunderstood the sizing of a slice of cake on their website. I questioned it with them and they rectified the wording immediately so others wouldn't be confused.

They are helpful over email and always very quick to respond. I also regularly order their letterbox specials for myself - delicious and always arrive quickly. I do find my preference is for the letterbox sizes to the packs of 4. The letterbox sizes are thinner, maybe this is a topping to brownie ratio thing for me?!
I don't mind the prices because I know they only use the best ingredients, which is a priority for me.

Anyway, love them and will continue to support an independent bakery.",Date of experience: 22 January 2024,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,08-Feb-24,"Wow, thank you so much for this review.

I have tasted a lot of brownies in my life, I have months without tasting Elizabeth's delights, and every time I order them again, I remember that hers are the best brownies on this earth - no exaggeration at all. The talent extends far beyond brownies too - if you've not tasted her blondies you also haven't lived, and likewise with any other baked goods that come out of that kitchen. I discovered EK Bakery many moons ago (pre pandemic maybe?) after asking her to custom bake me a Cherry Bakewell peanut butter brownie, and my all time fave, a Marmite Caramel Brownie. Since then I have asked for many a strange flavour combination, and she has yet to disappoint, allowing me to bend the rules on more than one occasion, and baking the weirdest of concoctions at my request. Thank you, Elizabeth - and you merry band of bakers. You make my baked goods dreams come true, and I salute you for it. Long may EK Bakery continue, and maybe one day I will cross the threshold in person. Until then, please continue to send me your chocolatey delights.

Many thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We offer cakes in multiple sizes and the mini size you had is our smallest one. It serves 2-6 people, depending on your portion preferences.

Additionally, we recommend storing the cake in the fridge and removing it around 1-2 hours before serving. The cake tastes best at room temperature but the refrigeration beforehand enables easy slicing and ensures a clean slice.

We'd love for you to try another cake with us, I'll follow up over email too.

1 review,Astrid Roth,AT,Updated 9 Nov 2023,Not only good looking!,"Not only good looking was the cake, I got from EK Bakery for my husbands birthday.
It looked fabulous and tasted so good!
I really like that it was possible to buy a candle and a card with the cake, since we where on holidays in London and so I didn´t have to worry about all that.
Picking up the cake was easy and the cake was ready even before the time it was supposed to.
Thank you so much!
